"""Implements the Singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance of a class
is created. Provides a get_instance() method to retrieve the singleton instance
and initialize() to create the instance if it does not already exist.

Example usage:

from singleton import Singleton

class MyClass(Singleton):
    pass

obj1 = MyClass.get_instance() 
obj2 = MyClass.get_instance()

assert obj1 is obj2
