**1. Set up your cloud-based workspace:**

- Access GitHub Codespaces and sign in to your account.
- Create a new codespace, opting for the blank template to start fresh. This will launch a virtual version of VS Code tailored for cloud development.

**2. Install Next.py:**

- Within the codespace's integrated terminal, type `pip install nextpy` to install the Next.py framework, enabling you to build web apps with Python.

**3. Create your project folder:**

- Click the folder icon within VS Code to create a new folder named `my_app`. This folder will house your app's code.

**4. Initialize your Next.py app:**

- Navigate to the `my_app` directory in the terminal.
- Run `nextpy init` to create the foundational structure of your app.
- Press Enter to select the default blank template for a simple, single-page app.

**5. Start your app:**

- Remain in the `my_app` directory and execute `nextpy run` to launch the app.

**6. Access your app:**

- Visit `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser to view your running app.

**7. Ensure visibility:**

- Navigate to the "Ports" tab within Codespaces and set the backend port visibility to "public" to enable access from outside the codespace environment.

 **8. Make a change and see the results:**

- **Locate the file:** Navigate to the `my_app/my_app` directory within VS Code and open the `my_app.py` file. This file contains the core code for your app.

- **Replace the text:** Find the instance of the text "High performance" and change it to "super fast".

- **Save the change:** Save the modified `my_app.py` file.

- **Observe the update:** Keep a tab open with your app running in the browser (`http://localhost:3000`). You should automatically see the text update from "High performance" to "super fast" on the webpage, showcasing the instant refresh capability of Next.py.
