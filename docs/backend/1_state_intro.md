# Introduction to State

Think of web app "state" as the ever-changing snapshot of your app's current situation. Similar to  similar to the RAM of a computer used to store temporary data. In this metaphor, your database serves as the hard drive, storing more permanent data. The state can include user inputs, preferences, and any other dynamic data that changes over time

In Nextpy, state management happens on the backed. That means you can focus on crafting seamless user experiences without getting bogged down in complexities.

Imagine a simple counter application. The state would include the current count, which changes each time the user clicks a button to increment it. This count is part of the application's state because it can change while the user interacts with the application.

## Where you might use state management ?

State management comes in handy in various situations, especially when dealing with dynamic data and user interactions in web applications. Here are some key areas where it shines:

**1. Complex User Interfaces:**

Imagine an e-commerce platform where users can add items to their carts, adjust quantities, and apply coupons. Keeping track of each user's cart state, including item details, prices, and discounts, becomes complex without proper state management. A dedicated system ensures consistent data across the platform and a smooth shopping experience.

**2. Real-time Applications:**

Think of a live chat app where messages appear instantly for all users. Maintaining synchronized state across multiple users and devices requires efficient state management. It ensures everyone sees the latest messages and updates immediately, fostering a seamless and engaging real-time experience.

**3. Interactive Dashboards:**

Data visualization dashboards often involve user interactions like filtering data, changing timeframes, or drilling down into specific details. State management helps track these interactions and update the displayed data accordingly, providing users with a dynamic and responsive way to explore information.

## Intuitive analogy

**Imagine your app is a fancy restaurant:**

- **State Class:** It's the recipe book, outlining the ingredients and steps for each dish. The State Class is where you define the structure of your application's state. It is a blueprint for the data your app will track and manage. To create a state class, you inherit from `xt.State`:

```python
import nextpy as xt

class MyState(xt.State):
    # State variables and event handlers go here
```

- **Vars:** They're the ingredients and dishes themselves. In nextpy they are special type of python variables within the state class that represent the data your application will manage. Check out Var operations documentation to know how they are different .
    - **Base Vars:** They're like fresh ingredients ready to be cooked and served directly (user-updated data).
    - **Computed Vars:** They're like side dishes that automatically adjust based on the main course (data derived from other vars).
- **Event Handlers:** They're the chefs who prepare and modify dishes in response to orders (user actions).
- **Event Triggers:** They're like bells customers ring when they want specific dishes (user interactions).

**How state works:**

1. **Follow the recipe:** Create a State Class to define your app's data structure like a recipe book.
2. **Stock the pantry:** Define Base Vars for raw ingredients and Computed Vars for derived dishes.
3. **Get ready to cook:** Create Event Handlers to handle orders (user actions) by preparing dishes.
4. **Install order buttons:** Connect Event Triggers to components like buttons so user actions ring the bell.

**Now, when a customer places an order:**

1. They ring the bell (trigger an event).
2. The chef (event handler) grabs the recipe and ingredients (state variables).
3. They cook the dish according to the recipe (update state variables).
4. The side dishes adjust automatically based on the main course (computed vars update).
5. The waiter serves the delicious dish (updated UI reflects the new state).
