### Tutorial: Implementing Chain of Thought

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to combine the capabilities of Nextpy with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to perform advanced question analysis. Our goal is to create a system that identifies the intent and requirements of a given question and, based on available knowledge, generates a comprehensive answer or identifies gaps in the available information.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later.
- Nextpy library installed.
- Access to OpenAI's API (GPT-3.5-turbo model).

#### Step 1: Import Libraries and Set Up the OpenAI Engine

First, import the necessary libraries from Nextpy and set up the OpenAI engine:

```python
from nextpy.ai import engine
import re

# Get the OpenAI API key
api_key = 'sk-api_key'
model = engine.llms.OpenAI("gpt-3.5-turbo", chat_mode=True, api_key=api_key, caching=False)
```

#### Step 2: Define the Chain of Thought

The next step is to define a template for the chain of thought. This template will guide the AI in processing the user's question and formulating an appropriate response:

```python
chain_of_thought = engine('''
{{#system~}}
You are a knowledgeable and efficient assistant.
{{~/system}}

{{#user~}}
Please analyze the following question:
{{query}}
Identify the exact topic and user intent in one sentence.
{{~/user}}

{{#assistant~}}
{{gen 'topic_intent' temperature=0 max_tokens=50}}
{{~/assistant}}

{{#user~}}
Based on the topic and intent, what information is required to adequately answer this question?
{{~/user}}

{{#assistant~}}
{{gen 'info_requirements' temperature=0 max_tokens=100}}
{{~/assistant}}

{{#user~}}
Here is a text source that might contain the answer:
{{knowledge}}
Analyze if this text contains the necessary information and respond with 'Yes' or 'No'.
{{~/user}}

{{#assistant~}}
{{gen 'text_analysis_conclusion' temperature=0 max_tokens=50}}
{{~/assistant}}

{{#if (contains text_analysis_conclusion 'Yes')}}
{{#user~}}
This is some knowledge:
{{knowledge}}
Generate a comprehensive answer based on the knowledge provided.
{{~/user}}         
{{#assistant~}}
{{gen 'final_answer_based_on_knowledge' temperature=0 max_tokens=300}}
{{~/assistant}}

{{else}}
{{#user~}}
Generate a question that would elicit the missing information.
{{~/user}}
{{#assistant~}}              
{{gen 'question_for_missing_info' temperature=0 max_tokens=300}}
{{~/assistant}}
{{/if}}
''', llm=model)
```

#### Step 3: Define Questions and Knowledge Sources

Now, provide a list of questions and corresponding knowledge sources that the AI will use:

```python
questions = [
    "What are the health benefits of regular exercise?",
    "How do changes in ocean temperature affect marine life?",
    "What are the implications of AI in healthcare?"
]

knowledge = [
    "Regular exercise contributes to improved cardiovascular health, ...",
    "The ocean is a vast and complex ecosystem. ...",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving and being integrated into various sectors, including healthcare. ..."
]
```

#### Step 4: Process the Questions and Display Output

Finally, iterate over the questions and knowledge, processing each through the chain of thought, and then display the results:

```python
# Inspect the output
for i, (question, knowledge) in enumerate(zip(questions, knowledge)):
    output = chain_of_thought(query=question, knowledge=knowledge)
    print(output)
    print(f'--------{i}----------')
    print("Question: ", question)
    print("Intent: " + output['topic_intent'])
    print("Info Requirements: " + output['info_requirements'])
    print("Analysis: " + output['text_analysis_conclusion'])
    
    # Check if the final answer is based on the knowledge or a generated question for missing info
    if 'final_answer_based_on_knowledge' in output:
        print("Final Answer: " + output['final_answer_based_on_knowledge'])
    elif 'question_for_missing_info' in output:
        print("Question for Missing Info: " + output['question_for_missing_info'])
    
    print('-------------------')
```

#### Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to leverage Nextpy and OpenAI for sophisticated question analysis and response generation. By following these steps, you can build a system capable of understanding complex queries and providing detailed, knowledgeable responses.
