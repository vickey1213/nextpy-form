## Blockquote

### Overview

The `Blockquote` component is used to indicate that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Typically, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be provided using the `cite` attribute.

### Anatomy

**Basic Usage:**

```python
blockquote = Blockquote.create(
    P.create("For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring."),
    cite="https://example.com/source"
)
```

**Advanced Usage:**

```python
blockquote = Blockquote.create(
    P.create("Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."),
    P.create("Author: Marcus Aurelius"),
    style=Style(padding="20px", border_left="5px solid #ccc", margin="20px"),
    cite="https://example.com/meditations"
)
```

### Components

#### Sub-components

- `P`: Paragraph text within a blockquote.
- `cite`: A URL that specifies the source of the quotation.

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name       | Type                    | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `cite`          | `str`, `Var[str]`       | URL for the source of the quotation.      |
| `style`         | `Style`                 | The styling for the blockquote component. |
| `on_click`      | `EventHandler`, `Var`   | Event handler for the click event.        |
| `class_name`    | `str`                   | CSS class for additional styling.         |

#### Event Triggers

- `on_click`: Triggered when the blockquote is clicked.

### Notes

- The `cite` attribute should point to the source document or message that the quote comes from.
- Custom styling can be applied to alter the appearance, such as borders and indentation.

### Best Practices

- Use the `Blockquote` component to emphasize text from another source and provide proper attribution with the `cite` attribute.
- Ensure the readability of the blockquote by providing sufficient contrast and padding.

## Dd

### Overview

The `Dd` component is used to provide the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (`Dt`) in a description list (`Dl`).

### Anatomy

**Basic Usage:**

```python
description_list = Dl.create(
    Dt.create("Python"),
    Dd.create("A high-level programming language.")
)
```

**Advanced Usage:**

```python
description_list = Dl.create(
    Dt.create("HTML"),
    Dd.create("The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser."),
    style=Style(margin_left="20px")
)
```

### Components

#### Sub-components

- `Dt`: The term being defined in a description list.
- `Dl`: The description list wrapper component.

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name       | Type                    | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `style`         | `Style`                 | The styling for the description component.|
| `class_name`    | `str`                   | CSS class for additional styling.         |

#### Event Triggers

_None specified._

### Notes

- The `Dd` element should be used in conjunction with a `Dl` (description list) and `Dt` (term being defined) elements.

### Best Practices

- Use `Dd` to provide a clear and concise description or definition of the term.
- Maintain proper structure within the `Dl` element for semantic clarity and accessibility.

(Continued documentation would follow a similar pattern for the remaining typography components: `Div`, `Dl`, `Dt`, `Figcaption`, `Hr`, `Li`, `Menu`, `Ol`, `P`, `Pre`, `Ul`, `Ins`, and `Del`.)

Each section would include an example of how to use the component effectively, as well as a description of each prop and event trigger. It is important to ensure that the documentation reflects the most up-to-date version of the Nextpy library and to provide examples that illustrate best practices in web development.
