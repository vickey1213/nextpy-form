## Details Component

### Overview

The `Details` component is used to create a widget that users can show or hide by clicking on a summary. It is commonly used to create an FAQ or to manage the display of additional information that the user can request as needed.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.el.elements.other import Details

details = Details.create(
    Summary.create("Click to view more"),
    "Additional hidden information"
)

# Set the 'open' attribute to show the content by default
details_open = Details.create(
    Summary.create("Visible by default"),
    "This content is visible because the 'open' property is set to True",
    open=True
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.el.elements.other import Details, Var

# Using a Var to control the 'open' property dynamically
is_open_var = Var(False)

details_dynamic = Details.create(
    Summary.create("Dynamic interaction"),
    "Content visibility is controlled by a Var instance.",
    open=is_open_var
)

# Toggling the state would show/hide the details
is_open_var.set(not is_open_var.get())
```

### Components

- **Summary**: A component that acts as a clickable label for the `Details` component.
- **Content**: The additional content that is hidden or shown when the `Summary` is clicked.

### Properties Table

| Prop Name         | Type                                              | Description                                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| open              | `Optional[Union[Var[Union[str, int, bool]], Union[str, int, bool]]]` | Controls whether the details are expanded or collapsed.         |
| access_key        | `Optional[Union[Var[Union[str, int, bool]], Union[str, int, bool]]]` | Hint for generating a keyboard shortcut.                        |
| style             | `Optional[Style]`                                 | The inline style for the component.                             |
| on_click          | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Event handler for click events.                                 |
| autofocus         | `Optional[bool]`                                  | Whether the component should take the focus when the page loads.|
| custom_attrs      | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`            | Custom attributes for the component.                            |

... (similarly, for other common HTML attributes)

### Events

- `on_toggle`: Triggered when the `Details` component is opened or closed.

### Notes

- When using `open` as a `Var`, changes to the variable will automatically reflect in the UI without any additional code.
- All event handlers like `on_click` can be a single function or a list of functions.
- Custom attributes can be set using the `custom_attrs` property.

### Best Practices

- Use the `Details` component when you have supplementary information that is not crucial to the main content and can be optionally shown or hidden by the user.
- Consider accessibility by providing appropriate labels or ARIA attributes if necessary.
- Avoid placing focusable content within a closed `Details` component as it can be confusing for keyboard and screen reader users.

## Dialog Component

The `Dialog` component represents a modal dialog or popup that can be shown or hidden. It is similar to the `Details` component in usage but is typically used for more critical information or interaction that requires user attention.
