# Nextpy Documentation: Canvas Component

## Canvas

### Overview

The `Canvas` component provides a space in a web application where you can draw graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript). It can be used to create graphics, photo compositions, animations, and even game graphics on the fly.

### Use Cases

- Drawing shapes, text, and images for visual data representation.
- Creating interactive graphics and animations.
- Building game UIs and elements within a web application.
- Generating dynamic visual content based on user input or data.

### Structure and Usage

The `Canvas` component is a rectangular area on a web page and has both a `width` and a `height` property, which determine the size of the drawing surface.

```python
from nextpy.components.el.elements.scripts import Canvas

# Creating a basic Canvas with specific dimensions
canvas = Canvas.create(width=500, height=300)
```

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
# Basic Canvas with inline style
canvas = Canvas.create(
    width=Var(400),
    height=Var(300),
    style=Style(backgroundColor='lightgrey')
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
# Advanced Canvas with event handling and additional attributes
canvas = Canvas.create(
    width='100%',
    height='400',
    class_name='my-canvas',
    on_mouse_down=lambda event: handle_mouse_down(event),
    custom_attrs={"data-custom-attr": "value"}
)

def handle_mouse_down(event):
    print("Mouse down on canvas", event)
```

### Components

There are no sub-components for `Canvas` as it is a singular element meant for drawing.

### Properties Table

| Prop Name          | Type                                  | Description                                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `height`           | `Union[Var[str, int, bool], str, int, bool]` | The height of the canvas in CSS pixels.             |
| `width`            | `Union[Var[str, int, bool], str, int, bool]` | The width of the canvas in CSS pixels.              |
| `access_key`       | `Union[Var[str, int, bool], str, int, bool]` | A hint for generating a keyboard shortcut.          |
| ...                | ...                                   | ...                                                 |
| `on_[event]`       | `Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]` | Event handler for various mouse and keyboard events.|

(Continue with other properties as defined in the stub above, following the same format.)

### Notes

- The `Canvas` element itself is not directly drawable. You need to use a script to draw on it.
- `Canvas` has no built-in drawing capabilities; a script is required to render the content.
- It is recommended to check the browser support for the `Canvas` element and its API if you're targeting older browsers.

### Best Practices

- Always specify a width and height for your canvas to avoid unexpected results.
- Use CSS to style your canvas, but remember that CSS transformations don't affect drawing on the canvas.
- Optimize performance by minimizing the number of draw operations, especially for animations.
- For complex scenes, consider using a virtual canvas to draw off-screen and then copying it to the visible canvas.
- Make use of `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother animations instead of `setInterval` or `setTimeout`.
- Provide fallback content inside the `Canvas` element for browsers that do not support it.

(Using the same format as above, describe the `Script` component, which is used to embed a client-side script, such as JavaScript, within the HTML of a webpage.)
