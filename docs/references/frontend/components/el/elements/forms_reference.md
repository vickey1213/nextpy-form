# Nextpy Documentation: Components - Forms

## Overview
Forms are essential elements in web development, enabling users to submit data to the server. Nextpy provides a comprehensive suite of form components that mirror traditional HTML form elements, with additional bindings for state management and event handling.

## Anatomy
Nextpy form components are designed to integrate seamlessly with the library's reactive state system and event chain. They support `Var` objects, making it easy to create data-driven forms.

## Components

### Button
- **Purpose**: To trigger form submissions or other interactive behaviors.
- **Properties**:
    - `auto_focus`: Automatically focuses the button when the page loads.
    - `disabled`: Disables the button.
    - `form`: Associates the button with a form (by id).
    - `type`: Type of the button (`submit`, `reset`, or `button`).
- **Event Triggers**:
    - `on_click`: Executes a function when the button is clicked.

### Datalist
- **Purpose**: Provides an "autocomplete" feature for `input` elements by listing possible predefined options.
- **Properties**:
    - None specific to `datalist`.
- **Usage**:
    - Used in conjunction with `input` elements that reference the `datalist` via the `list` attribute.

### Fieldset
- **Purpose**: To group related form controls and labels within a web form.
- **Properties**:
    - `disabled`: Disables all the form control descendants of the fieldset.
    - `form`: Associates the fieldset with a form (by id).
    - `name`: Name of the fieldset, used for scripting.

### Form
- **Purpose**: Contains interactive controls for submitting information to a web server.
- **Properties**:
    - `action`: URL where the form's data should be submitted.
    - `method`: HTTP method to use for form submission (`get` or `post`).
    - `auto_complete`: Whether the form should have autocomplete enabled.
- **Event Triggers**:
    - `on_submit`: Executes a function when the form is submitted.

### Input
- **Purpose**: To let the user enter data.
- **Properties**:
    - `type`: Specifies the type of `<input>` element to display.
    - `placeholder`: A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control.
    - `value`: The content of the input.
- **Event Triggers**:
    - `on_change`: Executes a function when the input's value changes.

### Label
- **Purpose**: Represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
- **Properties**:
    - `html_for`: ID of a form control with which the label is associated.

### Legend
- **Purpose**: Represents a caption for the content of its parent `fieldset`.
- **Properties**:
    - None specific to `legend`.

### Select
- **Purpose**: To create a drop-down list.
- **Properties**:
    - `multiple`: Indicates that multiple options can be selected.
    - `size`: Number of visible options in a drop-down list.
- **Event Triggers**:
    - `on_change`: Executes a function when the selected option changes.

### Textarea
- **Purpose**: To let users enter multiple lines of plain text.
- **Properties**:
    - `rows`: The number of visible text lines.
    - `cols`: The visible width of the text control.
- **Event Triggers**:
    - `on_change`: Executes a function when the textarea's content changes.

### Other Form Components

## Notes
Ensure proper handling of form data and client-side validation where necessary. Use the `required`, `pattern`, and other HTML5 attributes to enforce constraints.

## Best Practices
- Use the `name` attribute for form elements to ensure the data is correctly submitted to the server.
- Utilize Nextpy's state management (`Var`) to create dynamic and responsive forms.
- Always validate user input on the server-side as well, even if client-side validation is in place.

Remember to provide accessible forms by using proper labels, legends, and tab orders, which are essential for users relying on assistive technologies.
