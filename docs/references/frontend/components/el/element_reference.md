# Element Component

## Overview

The `Element` class in the Nextpy library is a versatile building block for creating user interface components. It is the fundamental class from which all other Nextpy UI components inherit. This class enables developers to construct custom elements by specifying children, styling, event handlers, and other HTML attributes.

## Use Cases

- Building custom UI components.
- Wrapping a set of components into a single UI element.
- Attaching event handlers to elements for interactivity.
- Applying custom styles and classes to enhance the appearance.

## Anatomy

```python
# Basic usage of Element with children and style
from nextpy.frontend.style import Style
from nextpy.components.el.element import Element

my_element = Element.create(
    Element.create("Child 1"),
    Element.create("Child 2"),
    style=Style(background_color="#f0f0f0")
)

# Advanced usage with event handlers and custom attributes
my_interactive_element = Element.create(
    Element.create("Click me!"),
    style=Style(cursor="pointer"),
    on_click=lambda event: print("Element clicked!"),
    custom_attrs={"data-role": "button"}
)
```

| `id`           | `Optional[Any]`                                                  | The HTML id attribute of the element.                                        |

| `autofocus`    | `Optional[bool]`                                                 | Autofocus the element when the page loads.                                   |
| `custom_attrs` | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`                           | Custom HTML attributes to apply to the element.                              |
| `on_blur`      | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Event handler for the blur event.                                            |
| ...            | ...                                                              | ...                                                                          |
| `on_unmount`   | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Event handler for the unmount event.                                         |

### Event Handlers

Each event handler allows you to define interactivity for the component, handling various user actions such as clicks, focus, mouse movements, etc.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `key` prop is unique among siblings when rendering lists to help Nextpy optimize re-rendering.
- Event handlers are optional but can be used to add interactivity to your components.
- Always validate custom attributes to ensure they are compatible with HTML standards.

## Best Practices

- Use the `style` prop to apply inline styles, but prefer CSS classes for more complex styling.
- For performance, avoid creating new functions in the render method for event handlers; instead, define them outside or use memoization.
- When using event handlers, ensure proper cleanup (if necessary) in the unmount event to avoid memory leaks.
