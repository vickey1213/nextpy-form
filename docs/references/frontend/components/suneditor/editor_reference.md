# Nextpy Documentation: SunEditor Component

## SunEditor

### Overview

SunEditor is a lightweight, flexible, and customizable rich text editor component for Nextpy applications. It allows users to create and edit content with various formatting options, similar to what you would find in word processors like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. The SunEditor component is designed to integrate smoothly into full-stack Python applications, offering a wide range of features that can be easily implemented.

### Use Cases

- Building content management systems where users need to create and edit articles, blog posts, or web page content.
- Creating email templates or any application that requires rich text inputs.
- Integrating a text editor into a chat application for enhanced message formatting.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.suneditor import Editor

editor = Editor.create(placeholder="Start typing here...")
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.suneditor import Editor, EditorOptions

editor_options = EditorOptions(
    mode="classic",
    button_list=[["bold", "italic", "underline"]]
)

editor = Editor.create(
    placeholder="Start typing here...",
    set_options=editor_options
)
```

### Components

#### EditorButtonList

A list of button configurations for the editor toolbar.

- `BASIC`: A basic set of buttons for simple text formatting.
- `FORMATTING`: Additional buttons for undo/redo and text alignment.
- `COMPLEX`: A full set of buttons including media insertion and advanced formatting options.

#### EditorOptions

A configuration object for the SunEditor component.

- `default_tag`: The default tag used when pressing 'Enter'.
- `mode`: The mode in which the editor should start.
- `rtl`: Whether the text direction should be right-to-left.
- `button_list`: A list defining the buttons to display on the toolbar.

### Notes

- Children are not allowed within the `Editor.create` method.
- The `set_options` argument should be an instance of `EditorOptions`. It must not be a state `Var`.

### Best Practices

- Use the `placeholder` property to provide users with guidance on what to type in the editor.
- Utilize the `lang` property to localize the editor according to the user's language preference.
- Apply the `default_value` property to initialize the editor with existing content.
- Set `auto_focus` to `True` if the editor is the primary element users need to interact with immediately upon loading the page.
- Use the `style` property to adjust the editor's appearance to match the design of your application.
- Pay attention to the `on_change` event to capture content changes and enable auto-saving or other real-time features.
- To avoid unnecessary re-renders, refrain from changing the `set_contents` property unless it's necessary to update the editor content programmatically.

### Events

Each of the following event properties can be assigned an event handler that executes custom logic when the specified event occurs:

- `on_blur`: Triggered when the editor loses focus.
- `on_change`: Triggered when the content of the editor changes.
- `on_click`: Triggered when the editor is clicked.
- ... (list other events similarly, such as `on_focus`, `on_input`, `on_mouse_down`, etc.)

### Code Snippets

#### Setting the Language

```python
editor = Editor.create(lang="es")  # Spanish language for the editor
```

#### Handling Content Change

```python
def handle_content_change(content):
    print("Content changed:", content)

editor = Editor.create(on_change=handle_content_change)
```

#### Setting Editor Contents Programmatically

```python
editor = Editor.create(set_contents="Initial content for the editor.")
```

#### Disabling the Editor

```python
editor = Editor.create(disable=True)  # The editor will be disabled and not editable
```

#### Customizing Toolbar Buttons

```python
from nextpy.components.suneditor import Editor, EditorButtonList

editor = Editor.create(set_options={"button_list": EditorButtonList.FORMATTING.value})
```

### Conclusion

The SunEditor component provides an extensive set of features for rich text editing within Nextpy applications. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this documentation, developers can leverage this powerful component to enhance the user experience and functionality of their web applications.
