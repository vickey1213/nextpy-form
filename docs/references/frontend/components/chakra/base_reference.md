# Nextpy Chakra UI Components Documentation

## ChakraProvider

### Overview

The `ChakraProvider` component in Nextpy is responsible for providing the Chakra UI context to your application. It wraps your app's components and provides a theme to all Chakra components within your application. This is similar to the `ThemeProvider` from styled-components or `MuiThemeProvider` from Material-UI.

### Use Cases

- Setting up global theming and style configuration for a Nextpy app.
- Providing consistent look-and-feel across all Chakra UI components.

### Anatomy

To use `ChakraProvider`, import it from Nextpy's Chakra UI components and wrap your application or a section of it with this provider.

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.base import ChakraProvider

app_layout = ChakraProvider.create(
    # Your app's components go here
)
```

### Components

#### Properties Table

Prop Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`theme` | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]` | The theme object to be used by Chakra UI components.
`style` | `Optional[Style]` | Optional styling for the ChakraProvider component.
`key` | `Optional[Any]` | A unique key that identifies this provider.
`id` | `Optional[Any]` | The DOM id for the component.
`class_name` | `Optional[Any]` | The CSS class name for the component.
`autofocus` | `Optional[bool]` | Whether the component should automatically focus when the page is loaded.

#### Event Triggers

Event | Description
--- | ---
`on_mount` | Triggered when the component is mounted.
`on_unmount` | Triggered when the component is unmounted.

### Notes

- Only one `ChakraProvider` should be used in your application. It should be placed at the root level to ensure all components have access to the theme context.
- Custom themes can be passed to the `theme` prop to customize the default Chakra UI theme.

### Best Practices

- Define a custom theme object that aligns with your branding guidelines and pass it to the `theme` prop for consistent styling across your app.
- Use `ChakraProvider` at the highest level possible in your component tree to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## Global

### Overview

The `Global` component in Nextpy is used to inject global CSS styles. It is useful for setting up CSS resets, global font faces, or any other global styles that need to be applied to the entire application.

### Use Cases

- Resetting default browser styles.
- Defining global font faces or CSS variables.
- Applying consistent base styles to the entire application.

### Anatomy

To use `Global`, import it from Nextpy's Chakra UI components and use it to define your global styles.

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.base import Global

global_styles = Global.create(
    styles="""
        body {
            margin: 0;
            font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
        }
    """
)
```

### Components

#### Properties Table

Prop Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`styles` | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]` | CSS string or a variable containing CSS to be injected globally.
`style` | `Optional[Style]` | Optional styling for the Global component.
`key` | `Optional[Any]` | A unique key that identifies this component.
`id` | `Optional[Any]` | The DOM id for the component.
`class_name` | `Optional[Any]` | The CSS class name for the component.
`autofocus` | `Optional[bool]` | Whether the component should automatically focus when the page is loaded.

#### Event Triggers

Event | Description
--- | ---
`on_mount` | Triggered when the component is mounted.
`on_unmount` | Triggered when the component is unmounted.

### Notes

- The styles defined in the `Global` component have a global scope and will affect all elements in the DOM.
- It's recommended to use CSS variables for colors, fonts, and other theme-related properties for easier theming and maintainability.

### Best Practices

- Use `Global` sparingly and avoid defining styles that could be scoped to specific components.
- Combine `Global` with a custom theme in `ChakraProvider` for a powerful theming solution.

The documentation for the remaining components should follow a similar structure, focusing on clarity and providing practical examples. Ensure that you cover the purpose, anatomy, component properties, event triggers, important considerations, and best practices for each component in the Nextpy Chakra UI library.
