# Nextpy Documentation: Stepper Component

## Overview

The `Stepper` component in Nextpy is a navigational element that allows users to move through a sequence of steps in a process. It's typically used in multi-step forms, wizards, or processes that require a linear progression through a defined set of steps. The `Stepper` provides visual feedback on the current step and the steps that have been completed.

## Anatomy

### Basic Usage

Here is a simple example of using the `Stepper` component:

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.navigation.stepper import Stepper, Step

stepper = Stepper.create(
    items=[
        ("Step 1", "Description of step 1"),
        ("Step 2", "Description of step 2"),
        ("Step 3", "Description of step 3"),
    ],
    orientation="horizontal",
    index=1  # The index of the current step
)

```

### Advanced Usage

For a more complex example, you might want to include event handlers and style customization:

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.navigation.stepper import (
    Stepper, Step, StepDescription, StepIcon, StepIndicator,
    StepNumber, StepSeparator, StepStatus, StepTitle
)
from nextpy.frontend.style import Style

stepper = Stepper.create(
    index=2,
    orientation="horizontal",
    colorScheme="blue",
    size="lg",
    style=Style(margin="20px"),
    on_click=lambda event: print("Stepper clicked", event),
    items=[
        (Step.create(StepTitle.create("Step 1"), StepDescription.create("This is the first step"))),
        (Step.create(StepTitle.create("Step 2"), StepDescription.create("This is the second step"))),
        (Step.create(StepTitle.create("Step 3"), StepDescription.create("This is the third step")))
    ]
)
```

## Components

The `Stepper` component consists of several sub-components, which allow for customization and flexibility:

### `Step`
Represents a single step in the stepper. It can hold child components like `StepTitle` and `StepDescription`.

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name     | Type   | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `style`       | `Style`| The style of the step.                                       |
| `key`         | `Any`  | A unique key for the step.                                   |
| `id`          | `Any`  | The identifier for the step.                                 |
| `class_name`  | `Any`  | The class name for the step.                                 |
| `autofocus`   | `bool` | Whether the step should automatically gain focus.            |
| `custom_attrs`| `Dict` | Custom attributes for the step.                              |

### Event Triggers

- `on_click`: Triggered when the step is clicked.
- `on_blur`: Triggered when the step loses focus.
- `on_focus`: Triggered when the step gains focus.

Other sub-components like `StepDescription`, `StepIcon`, `StepIndicator`, `StepNumber`, `StepSeparator`, `StepStatus`, and `StepTitle` have similar property tables and event triggers.

## Notes

- The `index` property is required to indicate the current step in the `Stepper`.
- The `items` property should be a list of tuples representing the title and description of each step or the `Step` components themselves.
- The `colorScheme` property allows for theming the stepper according to predefined color palettes.

## Best Practices

- Use clear and concise titles for each step to improve user understanding.
- Avoid having too many steps in a single `Stepper` to prevent overwhelming the user.
- Make sure the stepper is accessible by providing appropriate ARIA attributes when necessary.
- Utilize event handlers to manage the state and guide the user through the steps.

This documentation provides an overview of the `Stepper` component and its usage within the Nextpy library. By following these guidelines, developers can effectively integrate the `Stepper` component into their full-stack Python applications.
