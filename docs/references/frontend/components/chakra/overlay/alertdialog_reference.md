## AlertDialog

### Overview

The `AlertDialog` component is used to interrupt the user with a mandatory confirmation or acknowledgment. This differs from a typical modal dialog because it often requires an immediate action from the user. It is useful for critical confirmations where you want to ensure the userâ€™s response is intentional and explicit.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Usage

To create an `AlertDialog`, you need to compose the `AlertDialog` and its sub-components. Here is an example of a simple `AlertDialog`:

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.overlay.alertdialog import AlertDialog, AlertDialogBody, AlertDialogFooter, AlertDialogHeader, AlertDialogContent, AlertDialogOverlay

alert_dialog = AlertDialog.create(
    AlertDialogOverlay.create(),
    AlertDialogContent.create(
        AlertDialogHeader.create("Confirmation"),
        AlertDialogBody.create("Are you sure you want to proceed?"),
        AlertDialogFooter.create(
            # Add buttons here
        )
    ),
    is_open=True
)
```

#### Advanced Usage

For a more complex `AlertDialog`, you can add additional properties and event handlers:

```python
alert_dialog = AlertDialog.create(
    AlertDialogOverlay.create(),
    AlertDialogContent.create(
        AlertDialogHeader.create("Warning"),
        AlertDialogBody.create("This action is irreversible. Please confirm."),
        AlertDialogFooter.create(
            # Add buttons here
        )
    ),
    is_open=Var(True),  # This can be a reactive variable
    least_destructive_ref="cancel_btn_ref",
    close_on_esc=True,
    on_close=lambda event: print("Dialog closed"),
    # other properties...
)
```

### Components

#### `AlertDialog`

Main component that houses the alert dialog and its sub-components.

**Properties:**

- `is_open` (Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]): Determines if the alert dialog is open.
- `least_destructive_ref` (Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]): Reference to the element that will receive focus when the dialog opens.
- `on_close` (Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]): Event handler for the closing action of the dialog.

#### `AlertDialogOverlay`

A backdrop that covers the entire view when the alert dialog is open.

#### `AlertDialogContent`

The container for the alert dialog's content.

#### `AlertDialogHeader`

Component for the header of the alert dialog.

#### `AlertDialogBody`

Component for the body content of the alert dialog, typically containing the message or question.

#### `AlertDialogFooter`

Container for the footer of the alert dialog, usually containing action buttons.

#### `AlertDialogCloseButton`

A button component that can be used to close the alert dialog.

### Notes

- Make sure that `is_open` is set to `True` to make the `AlertDialog` visible.
- Always provide a `least_destructive_ref` to ensure accessibility.
- The `AlertDialog` should be used for important confirmations to prevent unintended actions.

### Best Practices

- Use clear and concise language for the header and body to communicate the message effectively.
- Position action buttons in the footer in a way that guides the user towards the primary action.
- Make good use of event handlers like `on_close` to manage the state of the `AlertDialog`.
- Always consider accessibility, ensuring that focus management is handled correctly, and interactive elements are clearly identified.

For further customization and detailed API properties, refer to the official Nextpy documentation and the Chakra UI component documentation upon which `AlertDialog` is based.
