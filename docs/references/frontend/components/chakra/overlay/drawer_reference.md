# Nextpy `Drawer` Component Documentation

## `Drawer`

### Overview

The `Drawer` component is a sliding panel that overlays the main content and can contain additional information, navigation, or actions. It is often used to provide an off-canvas menu on mobile devices or additional options in a desktop application.

### Use Cases

- Mobile navigation menus that slide in from the side of the viewport
- Sidebar for filters or settings in a dashboard application
- Hidden panels for secondary navigation or actions in a content-heavy interface

### Structure and Usage

A `Drawer` component typically consists of several sub-components:

- `DrawerOverlay`: A transparent backdrop that covers the main content when the drawer is open.
- `DrawerContent`: The container for the drawer's content.
- `DrawerHeader`: A top section typically containing the title or summary of the drawer's contents.
- `DrawerBody`: The main content area of the drawer.
- `DrawerFooter`: An optional bottom section for actions related to the drawer's contents.
- `DrawerCloseButton`: A button usually placed in the header to close the drawer.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.overlay import Drawer, DrawerBody, DrawerHeader

# Usage in a functional component
drawer = Drawer.create(
    DrawerHeader.create("Drawer Title"),
    DrawerBody.create("Drawer body content"),
    is_open=True,  # The drawer is open
    placement="right",  # The drawer appears from the right side
    size="md"  # The size of the drawer is medium
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.overlay import (
    Drawer,
    DrawerBody,
    DrawerHeader,
    DrawerFooter,
    DrawerCloseButton,
)

# A more advanced drawer with a footer and close button
drawer = Drawer.create(
    DrawerHeader.create("Drawer Title", DrawerCloseButton.create()),
    DrawerBody.create("Drawer body content"),
    DrawerFooter.create("Footer content"),
    is_open=True,
    placement="right",
    size="lg",
    close_on_overlay_click=False  # Prevents closing when the overlay is clicked
)
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the `is_open` property is managed correctly to show and hide the drawer as needed.
- The `placement` property determines where the drawer slides in from, including `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
- The `size` can be adjusted to fit the content needs with options like `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `full`.

### Best Practices

- Use a `DrawerCloseButton` within the `DrawerHeader` for better accessibility and user experience.
- When using a drawer for navigation, ensure that it is accessible with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Keep the content of the `DrawerBody` focused and relevant to the context in which the drawer is used.
- Use `DrawerFooter` for actions that are directly related to the drawer's content, such as "Save" or "Apply Filters".
- Use appropriate `color_scheme` and styling to match the drawer's look and feel with the application's design system.
- Test the drawer behavior on different screen sizes to ensure a consistent and responsive user experience.
