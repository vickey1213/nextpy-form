# Alert

## Overview

The Alert component is a visual element used to communicate important information to the user, typically to draw attention to a specific state or issue that requires acknowledgment or action. It is commonly used to provide feedback on user interactions or system statuses, such as success messages after form submission, warnings about potential problems, or errors that have occurred.

## Anatomy

Basic implementation:
```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.feedback import Alert

alert = Alert.create(
    title="Operation Successful",
    status="success"
)
```

Advanced implementation with custom attributes:
```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.feedback import Alert

alert = Alert.create(
    title="Invalid Input Detected",
    desc="Please check the form fields for errors.",
    status="error",
    variant="solid",
    custom_attrs={"data-custom": "value"}
)
```

### AlertIcon

A component used to render an icon within the Alert component, indicating the type of alert (success, info, warning, or error).

### AlertTitle

A subcomponent used to display the title of the Alert. It's typically styled to stand out from the AlertDescription.

### AlertDescription

A subcomponent used for providing additional details or guidance within the Alert. It's often rendered in a less prominent style compared to the AlertTitle.

## Notes

- Use the `status` property to indicate the nature of the alert. Choose from "success", "info", "warning", or "error".
- The `variant` property adjusts the visual style of the alert. Options include "subtle", "left-accent", "top-accent", and "solid".
- Icons are included by default, but can be disabled by setting the `icon` property to `False`.

## Best Practices

- Keep the alert message concise and actionable.
- Use the `status` property to convey the right semantic meaning.
- Only use the alert for important, immediate information.
- Avoid stacking multiple alerts; consider alternative UI elements for less critical messages.
- When using the alert in a form, link the alert content to specific form fields if possible, to provide clear guidance on how to resolve issues.
