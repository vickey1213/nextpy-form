# Nextpy Documentation: Progress Component

## Progress

The `Progress` component in Nextpy is utilized to display the progress status for tasks that take a long time or have an unknown duration. It is commonly used to provide visual feedback to users during operations like file uploads, form submissions, or loading processes.

### Anatomy

The `Progress` component can be customized with various options such as adding stripes, animation, setting an indeterminate state, and defining the minimum and maximum values.

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.feedback import Progress

progress = Progress.create(value=Var(50))
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.feedback import Progress
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

progress_with_stripes = Progress.create(
    value=Var(70),
    has_stripe=True,
    is_animated=True,
    color_scheme="green"
)
```

### Components

The `Progress` component has several properties that can be used to customize its behavior and appearance.

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name          | Type                          | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| has_stripe         | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]` | If set to true, displays stripes on the progress bar.                                          |
| is_animated        | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]` | When true and `has_stripe` is also true, animates the stripes.                                |
| is_indeterminate   | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]` | If set to true, the progress bar will be in an indeterminate state, ignoring the `value` prop.|
| max_               | `Optional[Union[Var[int], int]]`   | Sets the maximum value of the progress bar. Defaults to 100.                                  |
| min_               | `Optional[Union[Var[int], int]]`   | Sets the minimum value of the progress bar. Defaults to 0.                                    |
| value              | `Optional[Union[Var[Union[int, float]], Union[int, float]]]` | The current value of the progress indicator.                                                  |
| color_scheme       | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`   | Applies a color scheme to the progress bar.                                                   |
| style              | `Optional[Style]`               | Additional CSS styles to apply to the component.                                              |

#### Event Triggers

The `Progress` component can also respond to various events such as clicks, focus, or mouse movements.

| Event Name          | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| on_blur             | Triggered when the component loses focus.    |
| on_click            | Triggered when the component is clicked.     |
| on_context_menu     | Triggered when the context menu is opened.   |
| on_double_click     | Triggered on a double-click event.           |
| on_focus            | Triggered when the component gains focus.    |
| on_mouse_enter      | Triggered when the mouse enters the area.    |
| on_mouse_leave      | Triggered when the mouse leaves the area.    |
| ...                 | Other mouse and keyboard event handlers.     |

### Notes

- The `Progress` component should not be used with user-controlled values without proper validation to avoid any potential security risks.
- When using `is_indeterminate`, the `value` prop is ignored, so there is no need to set it.

### Best Practices

- Use `color_scheme` to match the progress bar with the application's color palette for consistent UI design.
- Use `is_animated` judiciously, as excessive animations may distract users or cause performance issues on some devices.
- For accessibility, ensure that the progress status is conveyed to all users, including those using screen readers.
- Manage the progress state with `Var` to automatically update the UI when the progress value changes.

The above documentation provides guidance on using the `Progress` component within Nextpy applications, ensuring developers can effectively implement and customize it based on their requirements.
