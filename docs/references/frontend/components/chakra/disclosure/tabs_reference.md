## Tabs

### Overview

The `Tabs` component provides an easy way to navigate between multiple panels of content. It's commonly used for organizing content at a high level, such as switching between different views or functional aspects of an application.

### Use Cases

- Implementing an authentication interface with separate tabs for "Login" and "Register".
- Creating a settings page with tabs for different configuration categories.
- Organizing content in a dashboard with data visualizations spread across multiple tabs.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.disclosure.tabs import Tabs, TabList, Tab, TabPanels, TabPanel

tabs = Tabs.create(
    TabList.create(
        Tab.create('Tab 1'),
        Tab.create('Tab 2')
    ),
    TabPanels.create(
        TabPanel.create('Content 1'),
        TabPanel.create('Content 2')
    )
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
tabs = Tabs.create(
    items=[("Tab 1", "Content 1"), ("Tab 2", "Content 2")],
    align="center",
    variant="enclosed",
    color_scheme="blue",
    is_fitted=True,
    on_click=handle_tab_click
)
```

### Components

- **TabList**: The container for the tab headers.
- **Tab**: The individual tab headers users can click on.
- **TabPanels**: The container for the content of each tab.
- **TabPanel**: The individual content sections for each tab.

### Properties

| Prop Name      | Type             | Description                                             |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `items`        | `List[Tuple]`    | Tuple containing the label and content for each tab.    |
| `align`        | `Literal`        | The alignment of the tabs (start, center, end).         |
| `default_index`| `int`            | The initial selected tab index.                         |
| `is_fitted`    | `bool`           | If true, tabs stretch to the width of the tab list.     |
| `is_lazy`      | `bool`           | If true, defers rendering of tab panels until selected. |
| `is_manual`    | `bool`           | If true, tabs are activated manually.                   |
| `variant`      | `Literal`        | The visual style of the tabs.                           |
| `color_scheme` | `Literal`        | The color scheme of the tabs.                           |
| `index`        | `int`            | The controlled selected tab index.                      |
| `style`        | `Style`          | The style object for custom styles.                     |

### Events

- **on_click**: Event that is triggered when a tab is clicked.

### Notes

- When using the `is_manual` property, ensure that the tabs can still be navigated using keyboard shortcuts for accessibility.
- Lazy loading with `is_lazy` can improve performance when dealing with heavy tab panels.

### Best Practices

- Utilize the `variant` and `color_scheme` props to maintain consistency with the design system used in the rest of your application.
- Use `is_fitted` judiciously, as stretched tabs may not always provide the best user experience, especially on larger screens.
- Always include an `id` or `key` prop when creating tabs to ensure that the state is maintained correctly across re-renders.

## Tab

### Overview

The `Tab` component represents an individual tab header within a `TabList`. It is interactive and allows users to select the associated `TabPanel`.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
tab = Tab.create('Settings')
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
tab = Tab.create(
    'Profile',
    is_disabled=False,
    on_click=handle_tab_click
)
```

### Properties

| Prop Name      | Type             | Description                               |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `is_disabled`  | `bool`           | If true, the tab cannot be selected.      |
| `is_selected`  | `bool`           | If true, the tab is currently selected.   |
| `id_`          | `str`            | The unique identifier of the tab.         |
| `panel_id`     | `str`            | The id of the associated panel.           |
| `style`        | `Style`          | The style object for custom styles.       |

### Events

- **on_click**: Event that is triggered when the tab is clicked.

### Notes

- Ensure that `is_disabled` is used appropriately, as disabled tabs should be used sparingly and with clear indication of their disabled state.

### Best Practices

- Provide meaningful labels for each tab that clearly describe the content of the tab panel.
- Consider the order of tabs and ensure that they follow a logical progression or categorization.

## TabList

### Overview

The `TabList` component is a container for `Tab` components, which represent the navigational part of the tabs interface.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
tab_list = TabList.create(
    Tab.create('Tab 1'),
    Tab.create('Tab 2')
)
```

### Properties

- Inherits properties from the base `ChakraComponent`.

### Best Practices

- Maintain a consistent styling for all `Tab` components within a `TabList` to provide a cohesive user experience.

## TabPanels

### Overview

The `TabPanels` component is a container for `TabPanel` components, which contain the content associated with each tab.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
tab_panels = TabPanels.create(
    TabPanel.create('Content 1'),
    TabPanel.create('Content 2')
)
```

### Properties

- Inherits properties from the base `ChakraComponent`.

### Best Practices

- Ensure that each `TabPanel` has content that is relevant to the associated `Tab`.

## TabPanel

### Overview

The `TabPanel` component contains the content that is displayed when a corresponding `Tab` is selected.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
tab_panel = TabPanel.create('This is the content of Tab 1')
```

### Properties

- Inherits properties from the base `ChakraComponent`.

### Best Practices

- Use padding and styling to ensure that the content within `TabPanel` is clearly readable and well-presented.
