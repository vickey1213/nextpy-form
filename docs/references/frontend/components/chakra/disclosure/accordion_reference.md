## Accordion

### Overview

The `Accordion` component allows you to display collapsible sections of content, also known as an accordion. It is particularly useful when you want to organize content into separate sections that a user can expand or collapse independently.

### Use Cases

- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
- Product feature descriptions
- Organizing lengthy content into sections

### Anatomy

To use an `Accordion`, you will need to include the `Accordion`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionButton`, and `AccordionPanel` components.

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.disclosure import Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionButton, AccordionPanel

accordion = Accordion.create(
    AccordionItem.create(
        AccordionButton.create("Section 1 title"),
        AccordionPanel.create("Section 1 content")
    ),
    AccordionItem.create(
        AccordionButton.create("Section 2 title"),
        AccordionPanel.create("Section 2 content")
    )
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.disclosure import Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionButton, AccordionPanel
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

allow_multiple = Var(False)

accordion = Accordion.create(
    items=[("Section 1", "Content 1"), ("Section 2", "Content 2")],
    allow_multiple=allow_multiple
)

# To programmatically change the `allow_multiple` property
allow_multiple.set(True)
```

### Components

#### Accordion

This is the main wrapper component that groups all `AccordionItem` components.

### Notes

- When using `allow_multiple`, make sure to also manage the `index` prop if you need to control the expanded sections programmatically.
- Consider accessibility best practices such as ensuring the accordion is navigable via keyboard.

### Best Practices

- Label each `AccordionButton` clearly to indicate what content it relates to.
- Use `default_index` or `index` to set which items are expanded by default or to control the expanded sections dynamically.
- Keep animations enabled unless necessary to reduce motion for accessibility reasons. Use `reduce_motion` as needed.
- Utilize `AccordionIcon` to provide a visual cue for the expand/collapse action.
- Test the accordion functionality across different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior.

This documentation serves as a guide for developers to implement and customize the `Accordion` component within their Nextpy applications. It aims to provide clarity on the structure, usage, and customization options available.
