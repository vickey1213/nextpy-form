## Divider

The `Divider` component is a visual element that can be used to separate content within a layout. It can be oriented horizontally or vertically and supports different variants such as solid or dashed lines. This component is useful in organizing the content of a web application, enhancing its readability and structure.

### Anatomy

The `Divider` component is simple to implement. Here are some code snippets showing both basic and advanced usage.

#### Basic Usage:

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.datadisplay import Divider

# Horizontal Divider
divider_horizontal = Divider.create(orientation="horizontal")

# Vertical Divider (Ensure the parent element has a specified height)
divider_vertical = Divider.create(orientation="vertical")
```

#### Advanced Usage:

Custom styling and variants can be added to make the `Divider` fit better within the design of the application.

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.datadisplay import Divider
from nextpy.frontend.style import Style

# Custom Styled Horizontal Solid Divider
custom_style = Style(border_color="gray.200", border_width=2)
divider_horizontal_custom = Divider.create(
    orientation="horizontal", 
    variant="solid", 
    style=custom_style
)

# Vertical Dashed Divider with an ID and class
divider_vertical_dashed = Divider.create(
    orientation="vertical", 
    variant="dashed",
    id="my-divider",
    class_name="custom-divider-class"
)
```

### Notes

- When using the `vertical` orientation for the `Divider`, ensure that the parent container has a specified height, otherwise, the divider may not be visible.
- Custom styling can be achieved using the `Style` class. Be mindful of the existing styling provided by Chakra to prevent conflicts.

### Best Practices

- Use the `Divider` component to create clear visual separations between different sections or elements of your application.
- Choose an appropriate variant (`solid` or `dashed`) that complements the design language of your application.
- When applying custom styles, consider the overall design consistency and ensure accessibility standards are maintained, such as sufficient contrast for visibility.
- Ensure that interactive elements around the divider remain accessible and that the divider itself does not cause confusion by appearing clickable when it is not intended to be an interactive element.
