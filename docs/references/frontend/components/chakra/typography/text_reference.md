## Text

The `Text` component in Nextpy's Chakra UI library is designed to display text content within an application. It can be styled and customized using various props and can handle truncation of text to a specific number of lines, with an ellipsis to indicate overflow.

### Anatomy

The `Text` component is a fundamental building block for presenting textual information. Here are basic and advanced examples of its implementation:

#### Basic Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.typography import Text

# Basic text component
text = Text.create("Hello, Nextpy!")
```

#### Advanced Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.typography import Text
from nextpy.frontend.style import Style

# Advanced text component with styling and event handling
text = Text.create(
    "Welcome to Nextpy!",
    as_="h1",
    no_of_lines=2,
    style=Style(color="blue", font_size="18px"),
    on_click=lambda event: print("Text clicked!")
)
```

### Components

`Text` component is composed of several sub-components and props which are detailed below:

#### Properties

| Prop Name     | Type                                                         | Description                                                           |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `*children`   | `str`, `Var[str]`, other compatible components or variables  | The textual content or child components to be rendered within the `Text` component. |
| `as_`         | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`                             | Overrides the default tag (`<p>`), allowing for semantic HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<span>`, etc. |
| `no_of_lines` | `Optional[Union[Var[int], int]]`                             | Limits the number of lines to display, truncating the text with an ellipsis if it overflows. |
| `style`       | `Optional[Style]`                                            | Defines the CSS style of the component. |
| `key`         | `Optional[Any]`                                              | A unique key for React component reconciliation. |
| `id`          | `Optional[Any]`                                              | The HTML ID attribute of the component. |
| `class_name`  | `Optional[Any]`                                              | The CSS class name of the component. |
| `autofocus`   | `Optional[bool]`                                             | If set to `True`, the component will automatically focus on page load. |
| `custom_attrs`| `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`                       | Custom attributes to be passed to the HTML element. |

#### Event Triggers

| Event Name        | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `on_blur`         | Triggers when the component loses focus.    |
| `on_click`        | Triggers when the component is clicked.     |
| `on_context_menu` | Triggers when the context menu is opened.   |
| `on_double_click` | Triggers when the component is double-clicked. |
| `on_focus`        | Triggers when the component gains focus.    |
| `on_mount`        | Triggers when the component is mounted.     |
| `on_mouse_down`   | Triggers when a mouse button is pressed.    |
| `on_mouse_enter`  | Triggers when the mouse pointer enters the component. |
| `on_mouse_leave`  | Triggers when the mouse pointer leaves the component. |
| `on_mouse_move`   | Triggers when the mouse pointer moves over the component. |
| `on_mouse_out`    | Triggers when the mouse pointer moves out of the component. |
| `on_mouse_over`   | Triggers when the mouse pointer is over the component. |
| `on_mouse_up`     | Triggers when a mouse button is released.   |
| `on_scroll`       | Triggers when the component is scrolled.    |
| `on_unmount`      | Triggers when the component is unmounted.   |

### Notes

- The `as_` property should be used with caution to maintain semantic HTML for accessibility.
- When using `no_of_lines`, be aware of the containing element's width to ensure proper text truncation.
- Custom styles applied via the `style` prop should be carefully managed to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.

### Best Practices

- Use semantic tags in the `as_` prop for improved accessibility and SEO.
- Utilize the `no_of_lines` prop for text truncation to create a clean and uniform UI.
- When handling events, ensure that the event handlers do not cause significant performance issues, especially with `on_mouse_move` and similar high-frequency events.
- Custom attributes should only be used when necessary and should follow HTML standards.

Remember, the `Text` component is versatile and can be used in various contexts. Ensure that its usage aligns with the overall design and functionality of the application for the best user experience.
