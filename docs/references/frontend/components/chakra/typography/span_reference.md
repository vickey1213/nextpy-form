# Nextpy `Span` Component Documentation

## Span

The `Span` component in Nextpy is a fundamental building block for creating text elements within a web application. It is analogous to the HTML `<span>` element and is used to style and group inline elements without conveying any special significance.

### Overview

The `Span` component is designed to be flexible and lightweight, allowing developers to apply styles, attributes, and event handlers to a section of inline text within their applications.

### Use Cases

- Styling a piece of text within a paragraph
- Applying event handlers to text without changing its display property
- Grouping text for accessibility purposes or for advanced styling with CSS

### Anatomy

Here is a basic usage example of the `Span` component:

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.typography import Span

my_span = Span.create(
    "This is a text inside a span.",
    style=Style(color="blue", font_weight="bold")
)
```

And an advanced example with event handling:

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.typography import Span
from nextpy.backend.event import EventHandler

def on_click_handler(event):
    print("Span clicked!")

my_span = Span.create(
    "Clickable text",
    on_click=EventHandler(on_click_handler),
    style=Style(cursor="pointer")
)
```

### Components

The `Span` component allows the following properties:

| Prop Name      | Type                                                   | Description                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `as_`          | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`                       | Override the default tag (`<span>`).         |
| `style`        | `Optional[Style]`                                      | Style object to apply CSS to the component.   |
| `key`          | `Optional[Any]`                                        | Unique key for the component.                 |
| `id`           | `Optional[Any]`                                        | ID for the component.                         |
| `class_name`   | `Optional[Any]`                                        | Class name for the component.                 |
| `autofocus`    | `Optional[bool]`                                       | Auto-focus the component on page load.        |
| `custom_attrs` | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`                 | Custom attributes for the component.          |
| `on_blur`      | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, BaseVar]]` | Event handler for blur events.              |
| ...            |                                                        |                                               |
| `on_unmount`   | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, BaseVar]]` | Event handler for unmount events.           |

*Note: The table above is not exhaustive. Additional event handlers and properties are available and follow the same pattern.*

### Notes

- The `Span` component must contain text or inline elements as children.
- Avoid using `Span` for purely decorative purposes where a `div` or other semantic HTML would be more appropriate.

### Best Practices

- Use `Span` components when you need to style or apply event handlers to inline elements without disrupting the document flow.
- Utilize the `style` prop for quick inline styling, but prefer external stylesheets for more complex CSS.
- Use the `id` and `class_name` props to enhance the accessibility and testability of your components.
- Consider the accessibility implications of your implementation, such as providing alternative text or aria attributes when necessary.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the provided code examples, you can effectively integrate the `Span` component within your full-stack Python applications using Nextpy.
