### Basic Usage:

Here's a basic example of how to use the `TextArea` component:

Here's a basic example of how to use the `text_area` component:

```python
# Creating a TextArea component with binding to the state variable

text_area = TextArea.create(value=text_area_value, placeholder="Enter your text here...")

text_area_example = xt.text_area(value=text_area_value, placeholder="Enter your text here...")



from nextpy.components.chakra.forms.textarea import TextArea
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

# Creating a state variable to hold the text area value
text_area_value = Var("")

```

### Advanced Usage:

For more advanced scenarios, you can customize the `TextArea` with additional props:

```python
# Customizing the TextArea with error and focus border colors, and event handlers


    text_area_custom = TextArea.create(
    value=text_area_value,
    placeholder="Enter your text here...",
    error_border_color="red.500",
    focus_border_color="blue.500",
    on_change=lambda event: print("Text changed!", event.value),
    on_focus=lambda event: print("Focused!"),
    on_blur=lambda event: print("Blurred!")
)

```

| Prop Name          | Type                         | Description                                                  |

| default_value      | `Union[Var[str], str]`       | The default value of the textarea.                           |
| placeholder        | `Union[Var[str], str]`       | The placeholder text displayed when the textarea is empty.   |

| is_read_only       | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`     | If `True`, the textarea will be read-only.                   |
| is_required        | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`     | If `True`, the textarea will be required.                    |
| variant            | `LiteralInputVariant`        | Style variant: "outline", "filled", "flushed", or "unstyled" |
| name               | `Union[Var[str], str]`       | The name of the textarea form field.                         |
| style              | `Style`                      | Style object to customize component styles.                  |
| autofocus          | `bool`                       | If `True`, the textarea will be automatically focused.       |
| custom_attrs       | `Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]` | Custom attributes for the textarea element.                  |
| on_blur            | `EventHandler`               | Event handler for the blur event.                            |
| on_change          | `EventHandler`               | Event handler for the change event.                          |

## Notes

- Ensure that you bind the `value` prop to a `Var` if you want to manage the textarea's value reactively.
- If you use both `value` and `default_value`, the `value` prop will take precedence.

## Best Practices

- Use the `placeholder` prop to provide a hint to the user about what to enter in the textarea.
- When using `variant`, choose a style that is consistent with the rest of your application for a uniform look.
- Always include the appropriate event handlers (`on_change`, `on_blur`, etc.) to manage the state and validate the user input.
- Utilize the `is_required`, `is_read_only`, and `is_disabled` props to guide user interaction based on the context of the form.
