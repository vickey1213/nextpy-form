# Nextpy Documentation: Password Component

## Password

The `Password` component in the Nextpy library is a secure text entry field commonly used for entering passwords. It extends the `Input` component, inheriting its properties and functionalities while providing additional features suitable for handling password input, such as masking the entered characters.

### Use Cases
- User authentication forms where a password is required.
- Any form where sensitive information needs to be entered and concealed.
- User account management interfaces for updating or resetting passwords.

### Anatomy
The `Password` component is essentially an `Input` component with a type set to `password` by default. It supports all standard text input features, including placeholders, read-only states, and form validation states.

#### Basic Example
```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms.password import Password

password_field = Password.create(placeholder="Enter your password")
```

#### Advanced Example with Validation
```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms.password import Password
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

password_var = Var('')
is_invalid_var = Var(False)

password_field = Password.create(
    value=password_var,
    is_invalid=is_invalid_var,
    error_border_color="red.500",
    placeholder="Enter your password",
    on_change=lambda e: is_invalid_var.set(len(password_var.get()) < 8)
)
```

### Components
The `Password` component does not have additional sub-components.

### Properties Table
| Prop Name          | Type                                      | Description                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `type_`            | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`          | The type of input, set to `password`.    |
| `value`            | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`          | State var to bind the input value.       |
| `default_value`    | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`          | The default value of the input.          |
| `placeholder`      | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`          | The placeholder text.                    |
| `error_border_color`| `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | The border color when input is invalid.  |
| `focus_border_color`| `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | The border color when input is focused.  |
| `is_disabled`      | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | If true, the input will be disabled.     |
| `is_invalid`       | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | If true, the input will be marked as invalid. |
| `is_read_only`     | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | If true, the input will be read-only.    |
| `is_required`      | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | If true, the input will be required.     |
| `variant`          | `Optional[...Literal]]`                   | The input style variant.                 |
| `size`             | `Optional[...Literal]]`                   | The size of the input.                   |
| `name`             | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`          | The name of the input.                   |
| ...                | ...                                       | Other inherited properties from `Input`. |

### Event Triggers
The `Password` component supports all event handlers available for the `Input` component, including:
- `on_blur`
- `on_change`
- `on_focus`
- `on_key_down`
- `on_key_up`
- ... and more.

Each event handler can be set to a function that takes an event parameter and performs actions based on the event, such as validation or state updates.

### Notes
- The `type_` property is predefined as `password` and generally should not be changed for this component.
- Always ensure secure handling and transmission of password data to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### Best Practices
- Use proper validation, such as minimum length and complexity checks, to ensure strong password inputs.
- Pair the `Password` component with a label and error message display to provide user feedback.
- Avoid setting a default value for password fields to maintain security.
- Implement proper accessibility features, such as associating labels with inputs and providing descriptive placeholders.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can create secure, user-friendly password input fields that enhance the overall user experience of your application.
