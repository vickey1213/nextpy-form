##  Reference for nextpy/frontend/components/chakra/forms/input(Generated by a LLM. Pending Review)

This stub file provides type annotations and signatures for the Input components within the Nextpy library. Here's a brief overview of each component and its purpose, which should be reflected in the documentation:

### Input

The `Input` component is a basic text input field where users can type text. It supports various HTML input types, such as text, email, password, etc. It includes event handlers for common input events like change, click, focus, blur, and more.

### InputGroup

`InputGroup` is a wrapper component that allows you to have an `Input` element with attached elements on either side—such as buttons, labels, or other inputs—which are typically used to provide additional functionality or context to the input.

### InputLeftAddon and InputRightAddon

These components, `InputLeftAddon` and `InputRightAddon`, are meant to be used within an `InputGroup`. They allow you to add static elements to the left or right of an `Input` component. These could be labels, icons, or static text that are always visible and not interactive.

### InputLeftElement and InputRightElement

Similar to the `InputLeftAddon` and `InputRightAddon`, these components (`InputLeftElement` and `InputRightElement`) are also placed within an `InputGroup` to the left or right of the `Input`. However, they are meant for interactive elements like buttons or icons that the user can interact with.

For each of these components, the documentation should provide:

- **Overview**: A brief description of the component and its purpose.
- **Anatomy**: Example code snippets showing how to implement the component, both in simple forms and more advanced use cases.
- **Components**: A detailed description of each sub-component's properties, including a properties table with columns for the property name, type, and description, as well as any specific event triggers that the component supports.
- **Notes**: Any important considerations or warnings that developers should be aware of when using the component.
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines and tips on how to effectively use the component, including customization, performance advice, and common patterns.

Be sure to use clear and concise language, providing code examples that users can easily follow and adapt to their own projects. Remember to match the tone and style of other high-quality documentation resources to ensure a seamless developer experience.
