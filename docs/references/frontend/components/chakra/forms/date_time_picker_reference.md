## DateTimePicker

The `DateTimePicker` is a form control component that allows users to input date and time values. It is a specialized version of the `Input` component that provides a user-friendly way to select dates and times without having to type them manually.

### Anatomy

To create a `DateTimePicker` component, use the `DateTimePicker.create()` method. This method takes a variety of optional parameters that you can use to customize the component's behavior and appearance.

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms.date_time_picker import DateTimePicker

# Basic DateTimePicker
date_time_picker = DateTimePicker.create(placeholder="Select date and time")

# DateTimePicker with additional options
date_time_picker_with_options = DateTimePicker.create(
    placeholder="Select date and time",
    is_required=True,
    size="md",
    variant="outline"
)
```

### Components

The `DateTimePicker` component has several properties and event triggers that can be used to customize its functionality:

#### Properties

| Prop Name            | Type | Description |
|----------------------|------|-------------|
| `type_`              | `Var[str]`, `str` | Specifies the type of input. For `DateTimePicker`, this is usually set to "datetime-local". |
| `value`              | `Var[str]`, `str` | The current value of the input, can be bound to a state variable. |
| `default_value`      | `Var[str]`, `str` | The default value of the input. |
| `placeholder`        | `Var[str]`, `str` | Text to display when the input is empty. |
| `error_border_color` | `Var[str]`, `str` | The border color when the input is invalid. |
| `focus_border_color` | `Var[str]`, `str` | The border color when the input is focused. |
| `is_disabled`        | `Var[bool]`, `bool` | If `True`, the input is disabled. |
| `is_invalid`         | `Var[bool]`, `bool` | If `True`, the input is marked as invalid. |
| `is_read_only`       | `Var[bool]`, `bool` | If `True`, the input is read-only. |
| `is_required`        | `Var[bool]`, `bool` | If `True`, the input is required. |
| `variant`            | `Var`, `Literal` | The style of the input ("outline", "filled", "flushed", "unstyled"). |
| `size`               | `Var`, `Literal` | The size of the input ("sm", "md", "lg", "xs"). |
| `name`               | `Var[str]`, `str` | The name of the input element. |
| `style`              | `Style` | Custom styles for the component. |

| `custom_attrs`       | `Dict` | Custom attributes for the input element. |

#### Event Triggers

| Event Name          | Type | Description |
|---------------------|------|-------------|
| `on_blur`           | Event Handler | Triggered when the input loses focus. |
| `on_change`         | Event Handler | Triggered when the value of the input changes. |
| `on_click`          | Event Handler | Triggered when the input is clicked. |
| `on_context_menu`   | Event Handler | Triggered when the context menu is opened over the input. |
| `on_double_click`   | Event Handler | Triggered when the input is double-clicked. |
| `on_focus`          | Event Handler | Triggered when the input gains focus. |
| `on_key_down`       | Event Handler | Triggered when a key is pressed down while the input is focused. |
| `on_key_up`         | Event Handler | Triggered when a key is released while the input is focused. |

| `on_unmount`        | Event Handler | Triggered when the component is unmounted. |

### Notes

- The `type_` property is used internally by `DateTimePicker` and should not be changed from the default "datetime-local" unless necessary.
- When binding the `value` property to a `Var`, changes to the `Var` will update the input and vice versa.

### Best Practices

- Use the `DateTimePicker` for fields where date and/or time input is required.
- Make use of the `placeholder` property to provide users with guidance on the expected format or example input.
- Leverage the `is_required` property to indicate that the field must be filled before submitting the form.
- Use the `error_border_color` and `is_invalid` properties to provide visual feedback when the user's input does not meet validation criteria.

Remember to keep the documentation up-to-date with changes to the API and provide examples that are relevant to the most common use cases.
