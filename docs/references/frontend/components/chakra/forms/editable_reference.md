# Nextpy `Editable` Component Documentation

## Editable

### Overview

The `Editable` component allows users to seamlessly switch between displaying text content and an input field where the content can be edited. It is a versatile component that can be used in scenarios where in-place editing of data is required.

### Use Cases

- In-place editing of text, such as names, descriptions, or other short pieces of content.
- Editing table cells within a data grid.
- Anywhere a user needs to be able to switch between viewing and editing content without navigating to a separate form or page.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms import Editable

editable = Editable.create(
    value=Var('Editable Text'),
    placeholder='Enter text',
    on_submit=lambda value: print(f"New value: {value}")
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms import Editable

editable = Editable.create(
    value=Var('Editable Text'),
    is_disabled=Var(False),
    is_preview_focusable=Var(True),
    select_all_on_focus=Var(True),
    submit_on_blur=Var(True),
    on_change=lambda value: handle_change(value),
    on_submit=lambda value: handle_submit(value)
)

def handle_change(value):
    print(f"Value changed to: {value}")

def handle_submit(value):
    print(f"Submitted value: {value}")
```

### Notes

- When using `Editable`, ensure to properly handle state changes and submission to prevent data loss on blur or submit events.
- Be cautious with the `autofocus` attribute in modals or popovers as it can lead to unexpected user experience.

### Best Practices

- Use `placeholder` to provide guidance to the user about what type of content is expected.
- When using `submit_on_blur`, consider providing a visual cue or confirmation to the user that their changes have been saved or submitted.
- For better accessibility, ensure that the `is_preview_focusable` property is set to `True` so that users can navigate using the keyboard.
- Use proper validation for the `value` property to prevent submission of invalid data.
