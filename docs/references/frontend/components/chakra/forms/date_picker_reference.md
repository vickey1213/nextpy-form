# DatePicker Component

## Overview

The `DatePicker` component is a specialized form input that allows users to select dates from a pop-up calendar or by entering the date manually. It enhances the user experience by providing a straightforward and interactive way to input dates.

## Use Cases

- Picking birth dates for user profiles.
- Scheduling events or appointments.
- Selecting date ranges for booking flights or accommodations.
- Filtering data based on date criteria.

## Anatomy

Below are examples showing how to use the `DatePicker` component.

### Basic Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms.date_picker import DatePicker

date_picker = DatePicker.create(placeholder="Select date")
```

### Advanced Usage with Bound State

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms.date_picker import DatePicker
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

# Define a state variable for the date value
selected_date = Var("2023-01-01")

# Create a DatePicker component with bound state
date_picker = DatePicker.create(value=selected_date, placeholder="Select date")

# Handle date change
@selected_date.event_handler("change")
def on_date_change(new_date):
    print(f"Selected date: {new_date}")
```

## Components

The `DatePicker` component inherits all properties and methods from the `Input` component. Additionally, it may include date-specific properties as needed by the implementation.

### Properties

| Prop Name            | Type                                    | Description                                        |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `value`              | `Union[Var[str], str]`                  | The current value of the date picker.              |
| `default_value`      | `Union[Var[str], str]`                  | The default value of the date picker.              |
| `placeholder`        | `Union[Var[str], str]`                  | Placeholder text when the input is empty.          |
| `is_disabled`        | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`                | If `True`, the date picker is disabled.            |
| `is_invalid`         | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`                | If `True`, the date picker is marked as invalid.   |
| `is_read_only`       | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`                | If `True`, the date picker is read-only.           |
| `is_required`        | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`                | If `True`, the date picker is required.            |
| `variant`            | `Literal["outline", "filled", ...]`     | The visual variant of the date picker.             |
| `size`               | `Literal["sm", "md", "lg", "xs"]`       | The size of the date picker.                       |

### Event Triggers

| Event Name    | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `on_change`   | Triggered when the date selection changes.       |
| `on_focus`    | Triggered when the date picker gains focus.      |
| `on_blur`     | Triggered when the date picker loses focus.      |

## Notes

- The `value` should be in a format recognized by the HTML date input, typically `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The calendar pop-up behavior and appearance may vary based on the browser.

## Best Practices

- When using the `DatePicker` in forms, always provide a `placeholder` to guide the user.
- Use `is_required` to enforce date selection for critical forms.
- If default dates are contextually relevant, utilize `default_value` to pre-populate the picker.
- For a more controlled experience, consider binding the `value` to a state variable and handling changes with event handlers.
