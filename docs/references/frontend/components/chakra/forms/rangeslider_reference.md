# Nextpy Documentation: RangeSlider Component

## RangeSlider

### Overview

The `RangeSlider` component allows users to input numeric values within a specified range by dragging slider thumbs along a track. It's typically used for filtering data, setting price ranges, or defining any range of numbers.

### Use Cases

- Adjusting values within a defined interval, such as price filters on e-commerce sites.
- Setting a range for data analysis, like date ranges for reports.
- Customizing settings within a range, such as volume or brightness controls.

### Anatomy

The `RangeSlider` consists of a track, two thumbs that can be moved to select the range, and an optional filled track to visually represent the selected range.

### Basic Example

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms import RangeSlider

slider = RangeSlider.create(
    min_=0,
    max_=100,
    default_value=[20, 80]
)
```

### Advanced Example

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms import RangeSlider
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

# Two-way binding with a Var
range_state = Var([25, 75])

slider = RangeSlider.create(
    value=range_state,
    min_=0,
    max_=100,
    on_change=lambda val: print(f"Range selected: {val}")
)
```

### Components

**RangeSliderTrack**: The base track of the slider.

**RangeSliderFilledTrack**: The portion of the track that shows the selected range.

**RangeSliderThumb**: The draggable elements users interact with to select the range.

### Properties Table

| Prop Name               | Type             | Description                                               |
|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `value`                 | `Var[List[int]]` | The current values of the slider thumbs.                  |
| `default_value`         | `List[int]`      | The default values of the slider thumbs.                  |
| `direction`             | `str`            | The writing mode, either "ltr" (left-to-right) or "rtl" (right-to-left). |
| `focus_thumb_on_change` | `bool`           | If set to `False`, the thumb will not capture focus when value changes. |
| `is_disabled`           | `bool`           | If `True`, the slider will be disabled.                   |
| `is_read_only`          | `bool`           | If `True`, the slider will be in `read-only` state.       |
| `is_reversed`           | `bool`           | If `True`, the values will be incremented or decremented in reverse. |
| `min_`                  | `int`            | The minimum value of the slider.                          |
| `max_`                  | `int`            | The maximum value of the slider.                          |
| `min_steps_between_thumbs`| `int`          | The minimum distance between slider thumbs.               |
| `name`                  | `str`            | The name of the form field.                               |

### Event Triggers

- `on_change`: Fired when the value of the slider changes.
- `on_change_end`: Fired when the user has finished dragging a thumb.
- `on_change_start`: Fired when the user starts dragging a thumb.

### Notes

- Ensure the `min_` and `max_` values are set appropriately to avoid user confusion.
- `default_value` should be within the range defined by `min_` and `max_`.

### Best Practices

- Provide labels or tooltips to indicate what the range represents.
- When using in forms, ensure that the `RangeSlider` is connected to a form field with the `name` attribute.
- For a responsive design, consider the slider's width on different screen sizes.

The above structure should be followed for each component within the Nextpy library to maintain consistency and ensure quality across the documentation.
