## PinInput

### Overview

`PinInput` is a specialized input component designed to handle input of PIN codes or other similar forms of secure data entry. It typically consists of several individual fields that allow the user to input one character per field, improving both usability and security.

### Use Cases

- Secure data entry for PINs, passcodes, or verification codes.
- Input forms where fixed-length character input is required.
- Applications requiring an enhanced level of user interaction for entering sensitive information.

### Structure

The `PinInput` component is a composite component made up of multiple `PinInputField` components, each representing an individual input field for a single character of the PIN.

### Usage

To use the `PinInput` component, you must first import it from the `nextpy/components/chakra/forms` module:

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.forms.pininput import PinInput, PinInputField
```

Then you can create a `PinInput` component with a specified length, like so:

```python
pin_input = PinInput.create(length=4)
```

## Anatomy

### Basic Implementation

```python
pin_input = PinInput.create(
    length=4,
    placeholder="‚óè",
    mask=True,
    on_complete=my_on_complete_handler
)
```

### Advanced Implementation

```python
pin_input = PinInput.create(
    length=6,
    variant="outline",
    focus_border_color="blue.500",
    error_border_color="red.500",
    is_disabled=False,
    is_invalid=False,
    manage_focus=True,
    on_change=my_on_change_handler,
    on_complete=my_on_complete_handler
)
```

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name       | Type                       | Description                                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index`         | `Optional[Var[int]]`       | The position of the `PinInputField` within the `PinInput`. Automatically assigned. |
| `name`          | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]` | The name of the form field associated with this input.   |
| `style`         | `Optional[Style]`          | Custom style properties for the input field.             |
| `autofocus`     | `Optional[bool]`           | If set to `True`, the field will be auto-focused on mount. |
| `custom_attrs`  | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]` | Custom HTML attributes for the input field.             |

### Event Triggers

`PinInput` supports a variety of event triggers such as `on_change`, `on_complete`, `on_focus`, and `on_blur`, which can be used to execute code in response to user interactions.

## Notes

- The `length` property determines the number of `PinInputField` components created within the `PinInput`.
- When `manage_focus` is set to `True`, the focus will automatically move to the next input field once the current field is filled.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the `length` property matches the expected length of the PIN or code being entered.
- Use the `mask` property to hide input for additional security.
- Provide proper `variant` and `border_color` properties to match the style of your application and to indicate focus or errors.
- Handle the `on_complete` event to perform actions like form submission or data validation once all input fields are filled.
- Avoid setting `is_disabled` or `is_invalid` without proper user feedback to prevent confusion.
- Remember to test the accessibility of the component, ensuring it is navigable using keyboard input and visible to screen readers.

The `PinInput` component is a powerful tool for enhancing the security and usability of forms requiring PIN or fixed-length code input. By following these guidelines and best practices, you can effectively integrate the `PinInput` component into your Nextpy-based web applications.
