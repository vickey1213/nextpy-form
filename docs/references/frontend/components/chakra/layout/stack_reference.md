# Stack

## Overview

The Stack component in Nextpy is designed to be a flexible container for stacking elements either vertically or horizontally. It's especially useful for managing layout and spacing of child components without the need for manual style manipulation. Stack can be a powerful tool in creating clean and responsive designs with ease.

## Use Cases

- Aligning a group of buttons either vertically or horizontally.
- Creating form layouts where input fields need to be organized in a specific structure.
- Building a list of items such as comments or messages that are spaced evenly.
- Managing the layout of cards or tiles within a container.

## Anatomy

### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.layout.stack import Stack

# Horizontal stack with default spacing
horizontal_stack = Stack.create(
    *children,  # Replace with actual child components
    direction='row'
)

# Vertical stack with custom spacing
vertical_stack = Stack.create(
    *children,  # Replace with actual child components
    direction='column',
    spacing='24px'
)
```

### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.layout.stack import Stack

# Horizontal stack with wrapping and custom alignment
advanced_horizontal_stack = Stack.create(
    *children,  # Replace with actual child components
    direction='row',
    wrap='wrap',
    align_items='center',
    justify_content='space-between'
)

# Vertical stack with inline children and event handling
advanced_vertical_stack = Stack.create(
    *children,  # Replace with actual child components
    direction='column',
    is_inline=True,
    on_click=handle_click_event  # Replace with actual event handler
)
```

### Properties

### Event Triggers

| Event Name       | Handler Type                                         | Description                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| on_blur          | `Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]` | Triggered when the component loses focus.   |
| on_click         | `Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]` | Triggered when the component is clicked.    |
| ...              | ...                                                  | ...                                         |

(Note: The table above should continue with all the other event handlers supported by the component.)

## Notes

- Ensure that the children passed into the Stack component are valid Nextpy components.
- The `spacing` property is applied to all children unless overridden by individual child styles.

## Best Practices

- When using Stack to manage layout, it is recommended to use the `spacing` prop for consistent spacing rather than applying margins to child components individually.
- Prefer the use of `Hstack` and `Vstack` for horizontal and vertical stacks, respectively, as they provide defaults that match their intended orientation.
- Use the `align_items` and `justify_content` properties to align and distribute child components within a stack. These properties help avoid manual adjustments and keep the layout responsive.
- Consider wrapping children with the `should_wrap_children` prop when dealing with dynamic content that might need individual spacing control.
