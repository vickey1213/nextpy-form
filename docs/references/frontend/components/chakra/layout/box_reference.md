# Box Component

## Overview

The `Box` component is a versatile layout primitive that can be used as the building block for most user interface (UI) designs. It provides a way to group and layout child components, with customizable styles and event handling. `Box` is a part of the Chakra UI integration in Nextpy, offering developers a way to build responsive and accessible interfaces with ease.

## Use Cases

- Wrapping a set of elements to create sections within a page.
- Providing a common background, padding, or margin to a group of components.
- Creating custom containers for specific parts of the user interface, like a card or a modal.
- Handling common user interactions like clicks, focus, and mouse events.

## Anatomy

### Basic Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.layout import Box

my_box = Box.create(
    "Content goes here",
    style=Style(background_color="gray.200", padding=4)
)
```

### Advanced Usage with Event Handlers

```python
from nextpy.backend.event import EventChain

def on_box_click(event):
    print("Box clicked!")

my_box_with_event = Box.create(
    "Clickable content",
    on_click=EventChain(on_box_click),
    style=Style(cursor="pointer")
)
```

## Components

The `Box` component is a single entity with no sub-components. However, it supports various properties and event handlers.

### Properties

| Prop Name       | Type                                     | Description                                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `element`       | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | The HTML element to render.                            |
| `src`           | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | The source of the content, applicable for media types. |
| `alt`           | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | The alt text of the content, applicable for images.    |
| `style`         | `Optional[Style]`                        | The CSS styles to apply to the Box component.          |
| `key`           | `Optional[Any]`                          | A unique key for identifying the component.            |
| `id`            | `Optional[Any]`                          | The DOM id to assign to the component.                 |
| `class_name`    | `Optional[Any]`                          | CSS class to assign to the component.                  |
| `autofocus`     | `Optional[bool]`                         | Whether to focus the component on page load.           |
| `custom_attrs`  | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`   | Custom HTML attributes to assign to the component.     |

### Event Handlers

| Event Handler   | Type                                               | Description                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `on_blur`       | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list]]`   | Called when the component loses focus.   |
| `on_click`      | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list]]`   | Called when the component is clicked.    |
| ...             | ...                                                | ...                                      |
| `on_scroll`     | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list]]`   | Called when the component is scrolled.   |
| `on_unmount`    | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list]]`   | Called when the component is unmounted.  |

## Notes

When using the `Box` component, ensure that the properties passed are compatible with the intended HTML element. For instance, `src` and `alt` are relevant for image elements, but not for generic divs.

## Best Practices

- Utilize `Style` objects to define common styling patterns and reuse them across different `Box` components for consistency.
- Keep event handlers simple and offload complex logic to dedicated functions or classes.
- Utilize `key` props for dynamic lists of `Box` components to improve rendering performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Ensure accessibility by providing descriptive `alt` text for media elements and managing focus with `autofocus` where appropriate.
