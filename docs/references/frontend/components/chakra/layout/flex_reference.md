# Nextpy Documentation: Flex Component

## Flex

The Flex component in Nextpy provides a flexible box layout, commonly known as Flexbox. It's designed to provide a consistent and efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items within a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic.

### Use Cases

Flex is often used for:

- Building responsive layouts that work across different screen sizes.
- Aligning items horizontally or vertically within a container.
- Distributing extra space or shrinking elements to prevent overflow.
- Creating complex web layouts without using floats or positioning.

### Anatomy

To use the Flex component, you can create an instance of it with the desired configuration, including children elements and style properties that control its layout behavior.

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.layout import Flex

# Basic Flex container with horizontal direction
flex_container = Flex.create(
    Flex.create(style=Style(padding="10px", background_color="red"), *children),
    direction="row",
    justify="center",
    align="center"
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.layout import Flex
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

# Advanced Flex container with dynamic direction and wrap
direction_var = Var("column")
wrap_var = Var("wrap")

advanced_flex_container = Flex.create(
    Flex.create(style=Style(padding="10px", background_color="green"), *children),
    direction=direction_var,
    wrap=wrap_var,
    justify="space-between",
    align="stretch"
)
```

### Components

The Flex component doesn't have sub-components, but it interacts with other components placed inside it, controlling their layout and spacing.

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name     | Type                                     | Description                                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| align         | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | Defines the alignment of items along the cross axis.           |
| basis         | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | Specifies the default size of an element before remaining space is distributed. |
| direction     | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | Specifies the direction of the main axis which defines the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. |
| grow          | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | Defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.      |
| justify       | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | Defines the alignment along the main axis.                     |
| wrap          | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | Defines whether the flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. |
| shrink        | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`         | Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.    |
| style         | `Optional[Style]`                        | Additional CSS styles to apply to the component.               |
| key           | `Optional[Any]`                          | A key that uniquely identifies the component in a list.        |
| id            | `Optional[Any]`                          | The unique identifier of the component.                        |
| class_name    | `Optional[Any]`                          | The class attribute of the component.                          |
| autofocus     | `Optional[bool]`                         | If set, the component will automatically focus when the page loads. |
| custom_attrs  | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`   | A dictionary containing additional custom HTML attributes.     |
| on_blur       | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Event handler for the blur event. |
| ...           | ...                                      | Other event handlers follow the same pattern.                  |

### Notes

- When using properties like `direction`, `justify`, and `wrap`, ensure that the values provided are valid CSS values for their respective properties.
- If any style-related properties (`align`, `basis`, `direction`, `grow`, `justify`, `wrap`, `shrink`) are provided as `Var` objects, they can be dynamically updated, which will cause the Flex component to re-render with the new styles.

### Best Practices

- Use Flex for creating layouts that require alignment and distribution of space; for simpler layouts, consider using the Box component.
- Always provide a `key` when creating multiple Flex components within a loop or iteration to help Nextpy identify and manage these components efficiently.
- When using dynamic properties with `Var`, ensure you manage their state appropriately, updating them only when necessary to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Be mindful of the browser's rendering limits when creating deeply nested Flex containers or using many flex items, as this can impact performance.

By following the structure and guidelines provided in this documentation, you can effectively utilize the Flex component to build responsive and sophisticated layouts in your Nextpy applications.
