# Nextpy Documentation: Spacer Component

## Spacer

**Overview:**
The `Spacer` component is designed to create flexible space between items in layout components. It's similar to a "flex-grow" item in traditional CSS flexbox layouts, taking up any available space within its parent container. This component is useful when you want to push two or more elements apart, making the layout more aesthetically pleasing or organizing the UI according to the design requirements.

**Purpose:**
`Spacer` serves as an invisible separator, ensuring that elements within a layout (like a navigation bar or a sidebar) are spaced out evenly or according to specific layout needs.

**Use Cases:**
- Separating buttons or links in a navigation bar.
- Spacing out items in a footer.
- Pushing content to the right or left side of a container.
- Creating gutters between sidebar items.

**Structure and Usage:**

```python
from nextpy.components.chakra.layout import Spacer

# Creating a Spacer component
spacer = Spacer.create()
```

## Anatomy

### Basic Implementation:

```python
# Basic usage of Spacer to push two components apart
from nextpy.frontend.components.chakra import Box, Spacer

left_component = Box.create("Left Item", style={"width": "100px"})
right_component = Box.create("Right Item", style={"width": "100px"})

layout = Box.create(
    left_component,
    Spacer.create(),  # This Spacer will push the two items apart
    right_component,
    style={"display": "flex"}
)
```

### Advanced Implementation:

```python
# Advanced usage with multiple spacers for different spacing
from nextpy.frontend.components.chakra import Box, Spacer

left_component = Box.create("Left Item", style={"width": "100px"})
middle_component = Box.create("Middle Item", style={"width": "100px"})
right_component = Box.create("Right Item", style={"width": "100px"})

layout = Box.create(
    left_component,
    Spacer.create(),  # First Spacer
    middle_component,
    Spacer.create(),  # Second Spacer
    right_component,
    style={"display": "flex"}
)
```

## Components

Since `Spacer` is a singular component without sub-components, it does not have a detailed properties table or event triggers. It inherits properties from the `ChakraComponent` class, such as `style`, `key`, `id`, `class_name`, and `autofocus`.

## Notes

- `Spacer` component is non-visual and will not be visible in the layout. It simply takes up space.
- The effectiveness of `Spacer` depends on the flex properties of its parent container.
- It's recommended to use `Spacer` within a flex container (`display: flex`) for it to work as intended.

## Best Practices

- Use `Spacer` to create a balanced layout without the need for precise calculations or custom CSS.
- Combine `Spacer` with flexbox properties on the parent container to control the distribution of space among items.
- Avoid using `Spacer` as a substitute for padding or margins when spacing is required around a single element.
- Utilize `Spacer` in combination with `Box` or other layout components to achieve complex layouts efficiently.
