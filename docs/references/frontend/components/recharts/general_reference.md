## ResponsiveContainer

### Overview
`ResponsiveContainer` is a wrapper component that allows its child components, typically charts, to respond to the size of their container. It adjusts the size of the charts within it to fit their container's width and height, ensuring that they are visually consistent across different screen sizes and resolutions.

### Use Cases
- Creating responsive charts that need to adapt to varying screen sizes.
- Embedding charts within dynamic layouts where the chart size cannot be predetermined.

### Anatomy
```python
ResponsiveContainer.create(
    aspect=2,
    width="100%",
    min_width=300,
    height=400,
    debounce=100,
    style=Style(border="1px solid #eee"),
    on_click=handle_click_event,
    children=[
        # ... chart components here
    ]
)
```

### Components
- **aspect**: (Optional) Defines the aspect ratio. The chart's aspect ratio will be `(width / height) * aspect`.
- **width**: (Optional) Sets the width of the chart container. It can be a percentage (e.g., `"100%"`) or a fixed value in pixels.
- **height**: (Optional) Sets the fixed height of the chart container.
- **min_width**: (Optional) Sets the minimum width of the chart container.
- **min_height**: (Optional) Sets the minimum height of the chart container.
- **debounce**: (Optional) If set with a positive number, it uses a debounced function to handle resize events, improving performance.
- **style**: (Optional) Customizes the appearance with CSS styles.

### Notes
- If `aspect` is not specified, the chart will stretch to fill its container.
- The `width` property should generally be set to a percentage value to maintain responsiveness.

### Best Practices
- Use percentage values for width to ensure charts resize properly with the container.
- Set `min_width` and `min_height` to prevent the chart from becoming too small and unreadable on smaller screens.
- Utilize the `debounce` property to throttle resize events for performance optimization.

## Legend

### Overview
`Legend` is a component that displays the legend of the chart, which helps to identify each data series within the chart.

### Use Cases
- Providing a visual guide for chart data series.
- Customizing legend appearance and position in relation to the chart.

### Anatomy
```python
Legend.create(
    layout="horizontal",
    align="center",
    vertical_align="bottom",
    icon_size=14,
    icon_type="square",
    style=Style(padding="10px"),
    on_mouse_enter=handle_mouse_enter,
    children=[
        # ... legend items here
    ]
)
```

### Components
- **layout**: (Optional) Defines the layout of legend items. Can be `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"`.
- **align**: (Optional) Aligns legend items horizontally. Options are `"left"`, `"center"`, `"right"`.
- **vertical_align**: (Optional) Aligns legend items vertically. Options are `"top"`, `"middle"`, `"bottom"`.
- **icon_size**: (Optional) Specifies the size of the icons in the legend.
- **icon_type**: (Optional) Sets the shape of the icons in the legend, such as `"line"`, `"square"`, `"circle"`, etc.

### Notes
- Not all chart types may support all `icon_type` shapes.
- If `layout` is not specified, the default layout will be used.

### Best Practices
- Choose a `layout` that complements the chart and container size.
- Ensure that the legend is placed in a non-obstructive position.

## GraphingTooltip

### Overview
`GraphingTooltip` is used to display tooltips for graphs. It provides information about the specific data point or area when hovered over or focused on.

### Use Cases
- Displaying detailed data when interacting with charts.
- Enhancing chart interactivity by providing on-demand data insights.

### Anatomy
```python
GraphingTooltip.create(
    separator=": ",
    offset=10,
    cursor=True,
    active=True,
    style=Style(background="#fff"),
    on_mouse_leave=handle_mouse_leave,
    children=[
        # ... custom tooltip content here
    ]
)
```

### Components
- **separator**: (Optional) The string to separate the name and value in the tooltip.
- **offset**: (Optional) Specifies the offset size of the tooltip.
- **cursor**: (Optional) When `True`, a cursor line or area is drawn; when `False`, it's hidden.
- **active**: (Optional) Controls whether the tooltip is shown or hidden; typically managed internally.

### Notes
- The `active` property is usually managed by the library and reflects whether the user is interacting with the data point/area.

### Best Practices
- Customize the tooltip content to provide the most relevant information to the user.
- Use the `offset` property to position the tooltip appropriately to avoid obstruction of the chart or data.

## Label

### Overview
`Label` is a component used for displaying labels on charts, such as axis labels or annotations.

### Use Cases
- Adding descriptive text to charts for axes, data points, or areas.
- Enhancing data visualization through text annotations.

### Anatomy
```python
Label.create(
    value="Revenue (USD)",
    offset=10,
    position="insideTop",
    style=Style(fill="#666"),
    children=[
        # ... additional label components
    ]
)
```

### Components
- **value**: (Optional) The text content for the label.
- **offset**: (Optional) The offset to the specified position.
- **position**: (Optional) The position of the label in relation to its bounding box.

### Notes
- If `value` is not provided, the label will attempt to use the child content.
- The `position` property supports a wide range of values for flexible placement.

### Best Practices
- Use meaningful text for the `value` to clearly describe the associated data.
- Position the label to enhance readability and avoid overlapping with other chart elements.

## LabelList

### Overview
`LabelList` is a component that renders a list of labels on data points within a chart.

### Use Cases
- Displaying values or categories directly on a chart's data points for quick reference.
- Enhancing data charts with embedded text information.

### Anatomy
```python
LabelList.create(
    data_key="name",
    position="top",
    offset=5,
    fill="#000",
    stroke="none",
    style=Style(font_size="12px"),
    children=[
        # ... additional customization components
    ]
)
```

### Components
- **data_key**: (Optional) The key of a group of data values used for the labels.
- **position**: (Optional) Specifies the label's position relative to its data point.
- **offset**: (Optional) The offset to the specified position.
- **fill**: (Optional) The fill color for the label text.
- **stroke**: (Optional) The stroke color for the text.

### Notes
- `data_key` should match a key in the data provided to the chart.

### Best Practices
- Select a `position` that avoids occluding data points or other chart elements.
- Use `fill` and `stroke` to ensure text is legible against the chart's background and data colors.
