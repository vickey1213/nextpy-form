# Recharts

## Overview

Recharts is a comprehensive chart library built on React components. It leverages D3.js under the hood for sophisticated charting capabilities but provides a more react-friendly API.

## Purpose

The purpose of Recharts is to enable developers to create rich, interactive charts in their web applications with ease. It offers a declarative React interface to construct charts with a familiar component-based approach.

## Use Cases

Recharts can be used in various scenarios where data visualization is key, such as:

- Dashboards for monitoring business metrics
- Analytical tools for data science and statistics
- Interactive reports in web applications
- Real-time data tracking interfaces

## Anatomy

### Basic Implementation

```python
import nextpy.components.recharts as Recharts

# Simple LineChart component
line_chart = Recharts.RechartsCharts.create(
    # Here, you would pass in the specific child components and props required for a LineChart
)
```

### Advanced Implementation

```python
import nextpy.components.recharts as Recharts

# A more complex chart with multiple types of data representation
complex_chart = Recharts.RechartsCharts.create(
    # Define properties and children components with specific roles, such as XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, Legend, etc.
)
```

## Components

### `RechartsCharts`

A component for rendering charts without server-side rendering, suitable for complex visualizations that require client-side interaction.

**Properties**

| Prop Name       | Type    | Description                                  |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `style`         | `Style` | Custom styles for the chart component.       |
| `key`           | `Any`   | A unique key for identifying the component.  |
| `id`            | `Any`   | The DOM id for the component.                |
| `class_name`    | `Any`   | CSS class name for additional styling.       |
| `autofocus`     | `bool`  | Auto-focus the component when the page loads.|
| `custom_attrs`  | `Dict`  | Custom attributes for the chart component.   |
| `on_blur`       | `Event` | Event handler for the blur event.            |
| ...             |         |                                              |

**Event Triggers**

- `on_click`: Triggered when the chart is clicked.
- `on_mouse_enter`: Triggered when the mouse enters the chart area.
- `on_mouse_leave`: Triggered when the mouse leaves the chart area.
- `on_mount`: Triggered when the chart is mounted in the DOM.
- `on_unmount`: Triggered when the chart is unmounted from the DOM.

## Notes

- Ensure that the data passed to Recharts components is in the expected format to avoid rendering issues.
- Some chart types may require specific props or children components to function correctly.
- When customizing charts, consider the interplay between different components, such as the `XAxis`, `YAxis`, and the actual data representation like `Line` or `Bar`.

## Best Practices

- Use memoization where possible to avoid unnecessary re-renders, especially for charts with large datasets.
- When applying styles, use the `style` prop rather than manipulating DOM elements directly for better performance and maintainability.
- Keep interactivity in mind; consider adding tooltips, legends, and responsive features to enhance user experience.
- Test charts on different screen sizes to ensure they are responsive and legible.
