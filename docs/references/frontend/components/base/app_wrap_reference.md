# AppWrap Component

## Overview

`AppWrap` is a fundamental component in the Nextpy library, designed to serve as a wrapper for a group of elements in a Nextpy application. This component is similar to a div element in HTML and is commonly used for grouping and styling sets of components, handling events, or applying a common set of attributes.

## Anatomy

### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.frontend.components.base.app_wrap import AppWrap
from nextpy.frontend.style import Style

# Basic usage of AppWrap to group components with an applied style
my_style = Style(display="flex", flexDirection="column", padding="20px")
app_wrap = AppWrap.create(
    Component1(),
    Component2(),
    style=my_style,
    key="app_wrap_key"
)
```

### Advanced Implementation

```python
# Advanced usage with event handling and custom attributes
def on_click_handler(event):
    print("AppWrap clicked!", event)

app_wrap_advanced = AppWrap.create(
    Component1(),
    Component2(),
    on_click=on_click_handler,
    custom_attrs={"data-custom": "value"}
)
```

## Components

The `AppWrap` component does not contain any sub-components but can hold any number of child components.

### Properties Table

Prop Name       | Type                                                      | Description
----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------
children        | `Component` or list of `Component`                        | The child components to be rendered within the `AppWrap`.
style           | `Optional[Style]`                                         | Style object to apply CSS styles to the `AppWrap`.
key             | `Optional[Any]`                                           | Unique key to identify the component in the app.
id              | `Optional[Any]`                                           | DOM id attribute for the component.
class_name      | `Optional[Any]`                                           | DOM class attribute for the component.
autofocus       | `Optional[bool]`                                          | If `True`, the component will be auto-focused when it mounts.
custom_attrs    | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`                    | Custom attributes to be set on the component's root element.
on_blur         | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function]]`| Event handler for the blur event.
on_click        | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function]]`| Event handler for the click event.
...             | ...                                                       | Other event handlers follow the same pattern as `on_click`.

### Event Triggers

- `on_blur`
- `on_click`
- `on_context_menu`
- `on_double_click`
- `on_focus`
- `on_mount`
- `on_mouse_down`
- `on_mouse_enter`
- `on_mouse_leave`
- `on_mouse_move`
- `on_mouse_out`
- `on_mouse_over`
- `on_mouse_up`
- `on_scroll`
- `on_unmount`

## Notes

- The `AppWrap` component acts as a container and does not produce any content on its own.
- When applying styles, be aware that certain CSS properties may affect layout and positioning of child components.
- Custom event handlers must be defined prior to passing them as props to the `AppWrap` component.

## Best Practices

- Utilize `AppWrap` to group related components and apply common styles or behaviors to them.
- Keep the structure of the children within `AppWrap` simple to maintain readability and maintainability of the code.
- Use keys when dynamically generating multiple `AppWrap` components to ensure proper state management and re-rendering behavior.
- When handling events, ensure to prevent default behavior or stop propagation as needed to avoid unwanted side effects.
