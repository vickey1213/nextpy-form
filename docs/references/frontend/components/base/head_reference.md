# Nextpy Documentation - Head Component

## Overview

The `Head` component represents the `<head>` section of an HTML document, which typically contains metadata about the document, such as its title, links to CSS, and scripts. This is an essential component in a Nextpy application for defining the metadata of a web page and ensuring the correct resources are loaded.

## Use Cases

- Setting the page title.
- Including external stylesheets.
- Loading external scripts.
- Adding meta tags for SEO optimization.
- Defining link icons (e.g., favicon).

## Anatomy

The `Head` component functions as a container for all elements that define the document's head. It can hold various sub-components or elements that influence the metadata and resources of the page.

### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.base.head import Head

Head.create(
    # ... children components go here, like title, meta tags, and link tags.
)
```

### Advanced Implementation

The advanced usage of `Head` may include dynamic metadata adjustments, event handling, and custom attributes.

```python
from nextpy.components.base.head import Head
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

# Define a variable for dynamic title update
dynamic_title = Var('Initial Page Title')

Head.create(
    # children can include Title, Meta, Link, Script components
    Title.create(dynamic_title.get()),
    Meta.create(charset='UTF-8'),
    Link.create(rel='stylesheet', href='styles.css'),
    Script.create(src='scripts.js'),
    # Event handling and custom attributes
    on_mount=lambda: print('Head mounted'),
    custom_attrs={'data-custom-attr': 'value'}
)
```

## Components

- **Title**: Sets the page title.
- **Meta**: Defines metadata about the HTML document.
- **Link**: Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.
- **Script**: Allows the inclusion of external scripts.

| `id`           | `Optional[Any]`                                        | The DOM id attribute.                                     |
| `class_name`   | `Optional[Any]`                                        | The class attribute for the component.                    |
| `autofocus`    | `Optional[bool]`                                       | Autofocus on the component on page load.                  |
| `custom_attrs` | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`                 | Custom attributes for the component.                      |
| `on_blur`      | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Handler for the blur event.                       |
| `on_click`     | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Handler for the click event.                      |
| `on_mount`     | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Handler when the component is mounted.            |
| `on_unmount`   | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Handler when the component is unmounted.          |
| ...            | ...                                                    | Additional event handlers and properties as necessary.    |

(Include other event handlers as per the real implementation)

## Notes

- The `Head` component is not intended for regular content that should be displayed to the user. It is meant for metadata and resources.
- When using `autofocus`, ensure it is not distracting to the user or detrimental to the user experience.

## Best Practices

- Keep the head section concise and only include essential metadata and resources.
- Use `Link` components for stylesheets and `Script` components for JavaScript files, rather than embedding the code directly.
- Manage dynamic document titles or metadata using `Var` objects for reactivity.
- Utilize custom attributes sparingly and only when necessary for specific functionality.
- When handling events, ensure that the functions are defined outside of the render loop to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

This documentation should serve as a guide for developers to effectively use the `Head` component within Nextpy applications, ensuring that their web pages are properly configured with the necessary metadata and resources.
