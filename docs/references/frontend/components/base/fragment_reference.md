# Nextpy Documentation: Fragment Component

## Fragment

### Overview

The `Fragment` component in Nextpy is a lightweight container used to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. This is useful in cases where you want to return multiple components from a component's render method without creating a wrapping `<div>` or other element that might interfere with your layout or styling.

### Use Cases

- Grouping child components without introducing extra layers in the DOM.
- Conditional rendering of multiple components without affecting the layout.
- Simplifying component structures by avoiding unnecessary wrappers.

### Structure and Usage

`Fragment` is used to wrap one or more child components. It does not accept any styling of its own, as it does not translate to a physical element in the DOM.

Here's a simple example of how to use `Fragment`:

```python
from nextpy.components.base.fragment import Fragment

def my_view():
    return Fragment.create(
        ChildComponent1(),
        ChildComponent2(),
        # additional children...
    )
```

In this example, `ChildComponent1` and `ChildComponent2` are siblings wrapped by a `Fragment`. They will be rendered directly under their parent without an extra DOM element from `Fragment`.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
Fragment.create(
    ChildComponent(),
    AnotherChildComponent(),
    style=None,
    key=None,
    id=None,
    class_name=None,
    autofocus=None,
    custom_attrs=None,
    on_click=None,
    # ... other event handlers
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

For advanced use, you can include custom attributes and event handlers:

```python
Fragment.create(
    ChildComponent(),
    AnotherChildComponent(),
    custom_attrs={"data-custom": "value"},
    on_click=handle_click_event,
    # ... other event handlers
)
```

In the advanced example, `data-custom` is a custom HTML attribute, and `handle_click_event` is a function that handles click events.

### Components

The `Fragment` component primarily acts as a wrapper and does not have sub-components or properties of its own. However, it can pass event handlers and custom attributes to its children.

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name       | Type                                        | Description                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| *children       | Components                                  | The child components to be grouped by the `Fragment`.   |
| style           | Optional[Style]                             | The style object for the child components (if needed).  |
| key             | Optional[Any]                               | A unique key for the `Fragment`.                        |
| id              | Optional[Any]                               | The DOM id for the `Fragment`.                          |
| class_name      | Optional[Any]                               | The class name for the `Fragment`.                      |
| autofocus       | Optional[bool]                              | Autofocus the first child when the page loads.          |
| custom_attrs    | Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]        | Custom attributes to add to the child components.       |
| on_*            | Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, ... | Event handlers for corresponding DOM events.            |

### Notes

- `Fragment` itself does not render to a DOM element and thus does not accept style or class properties.
- Event handlers attached to `Fragment` apply to all its children unless overridden by the children themselves.
- Since `Fragment` does not produce a DOM element, it cannot be targeted directly by CSS selectors.

### Best Practices

- Use `Fragment` as a simple grouping mechanism to avoid unnecessary markup and simplify component trees.
- When using `Fragment`, ensure that any styling or event handling is appropriate for all children, as `Fragment` will distribute these to its descendants.
- Avoid using `Fragment` when you require a reference to an actual DOM element, as `Fragment` does not create one.

By following these guidelines, developers can effectively utilize the `Fragment` component in their Nextpy applications for a cleaner and more efficient UI structure.
