# ReactPlayer Component

## Overview

The `ReactPlayer` component is a versatile media player for React that can play a variety of media types such as video and audio. The component is designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, providing developers with a comprehensive set of properties to control the playback, appearance, and behavior of the media player.

## Use Cases

- Embedding videos from various sources such as YouTube, Vimeo, and local files
- Playing audio files with controls
- Creating custom media player interfaces
- Implementing video or audio players in web applications that require specific behaviors like autoplay, looping, or muted playback

## Anatomy

Here is a basic implementation of the `ReactPlayer` component:

```python
from nextpy.components.react_player import ReactPlayer

# Create a ReactPlayer instance with a video URL
player = ReactPlayer.create(
    url="https://www.example.com/video.mp4",
    playing=True,
    controls=True,
    loop=False,
    volume=0.8
)
```

### Advanced Usage

For more complex scenarios, you can customize the `ReactPlayer` with additional properties:

```python
player = ReactPlayer.create(
    url=Var("https://www.example.com/video.mp4"),  # dynamic URL controlled by a Var
    playing=Var(True),  # dynamic playing state
    loop=Var(True),  # dynamically control looping
    controls=True,
    light=True,
    volume=Var(0.5),  # dynamic volume controlled by a Var
    muted=Var(False),  # dynamic mute state
    width="640px",
    height="360px",
    style=Style(margin="10px")
)
```

## Components

The `ReactPlayer` component consists of the following properties:

| playing       | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | Controls whether the media is currently playing.                      |
| loop          | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | Determines if the media should loop after it ends.                    |
| controls      | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | Whether to show the native player controls.                           |
| light         | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | Shows a thumbnail that can be clicked to load the full player.        |
| volume        | `Optional[Union[Var[float], float]]`      | Sets the volume level of the player.                                  |
| muted         | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`        | Mutes the player.                                                     |
| width         | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`          | The width of the player.                                              |

## Notes

- Ensure that the URLs provided are from trusted sources to avoid security risks.
- Be cautious when setting `autoplay` in combination with `muted`, as browsers have restrictions on autoplaying videos with sound.

## Best Practices

- Use the `playing` prop to control the playback programmatically.
- Utilize the `volume` prop to adjust the initial volume or to implement custom volume controls.
- Apply responsive styles with the `width` and `height` props to ensure the player scales correctly on different devices.
- When using the `light` prop, ensure you have a placeholder image or thumbnail that is representative of the media content.
- Always provide accessible controls and consider accessibility guidelines when customizing the player interface.
