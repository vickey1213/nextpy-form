# Nextpy Documentation - Audio Component

The `Audio` component in Nextpy is a specialized variant of the `ReactPlayer` component tailored for audio playback. It enables developers to embed and control audio content with ease. This documentation will guide you through the usage of the `Audio` component and its features.

## Component Name: Audio

The `Audio` component is designed to play audio files from a given URL. It extends the functionality of the `ReactPlayer` component, focusing on audio-specific use cases.

### Overview

The purpose of the `Audio` component is to provide a simple interface for including audio media within your Nextpy applications. It supports various audio formats and can be used for a wide range of applications, such as podcasts, music players, or any other scenario where audio playback is required.

### Use Cases

- Embedding a podcast episode on a web page.
- Building a simple music player.
- Playing a notification sound in a web application.
- Creating an interactive storytelling experience with audio.

### Structure and Usage

To use the `Audio` component, you create an instance of it, providing the necessary properties such as the URL of the audio file, playback control flags, and styling parameters. The component can be controlled programmatically using Nextpy's `Var` objects or interactively by the user through UI controls.

## Anatomy

Below are basic and advanced implementation code snippets for the `Audio` component.

### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.react_player.audio import Audio

# Simple audio player with basic controls
audio_player = Audio.create(
    url="https://example.com/path/to/audio.mp3",
    playing=Var(True),
    controls=True
)
```

### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.react_player.audio import Audio
from nextpy.frontend.style import Style

# Advanced audio player with custom styling and event handling
advanced_audio_player = Audio.create(
    url=Var("https://example.com/path/to/different-audio.mp3"),
    playing=Var(False),
    loop=True,
    controls=True,
    volume=Var(0.5),
    style=Style(margin="10px"),
    on_play=Var(lambda: print("Audio is playing")),
    on_pause=Var(lambda: print("Audio is paused")),
)
```

## Components

The `Audio` component itself is the main component. Its sub-components are inherited from `ReactPlayer` and adjusted to cater specifically to audio media.

### Properties Table

| Prop Name       | Type                               | Description                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| url             | `Union[Var[str], str]`             | The URL of the audio to be played.       |
| playing         | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`           | Control playback state (play/pause).     |
| loop            | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`           | Whether to loop the audio.               |
| controls        | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`           | Display native player controls.          |
| light           | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`           | Display video thumbnail (not typical for audio). |
| volume          | `Union[Var[float], float]`         | Set the volume (0.0 to 1.0).             |
| muted           | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`           | Mute the audio.                          |
| width           | `Union[Var[str], str]`             | Width of the player (e.g., "640px").     |
| height          | `Union[Var[str], str]`             | Height of the player (not typical for audio). |
| style           | `Style`                            | CSS styles for the player.               |
| key             | `Any`                              | Unique key for the component.            |
| id              | `Any`                              | DOM id for the component.                |
| class_name      | `Any`                              | CSS class name for the component.        |
| autofocus       | `bool`                             | Autofocus the component on page load.    |
| custom_attrs    | `Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]`       | Custom attributes for the element.       |

### Event Triggers

- on_play: Triggered when the audio starts playing.
- on_pause: Triggered when the audio is paused.

## Notes

- Ensure that the audio URL is accessible and points to a supported audio format.
- Control properties such as `playing`, `loop`, and `volume` can be bound to `Var` instances for dynamic updates.

## Best Practices

- Use `Var` instances for properties to make the player reactive to state changes.
- Set `controls` to `True` for a better user experience, unless you are building custom controls.
- Provide adequate `style` settings to ensure the player fits seamlessly into your application's design.
- Always handle events such as `on_play` and `on_pause` to provide feedback or to track audio usage.

Remember that your documentation should be regularly updated to reflect any changes in the API or best practices. It should also be reviewed for clarity and accuracy by both peers and users, ensuring it remains an invaluable resource for developers working with Nextpy.
