# Nextpy Documentation for DebounceInput Component

## `DebounceInput`

**Overview:**  
`DebounceInput` is a component that wraps around a text input field, providing the ability to delay the processing of keystrokes until a certain amount of time has passed without any key being pressed. This is useful in cases where the application needs to process input text, such as searching or filtering, as it minimizes the number of processing events triggered by user input.

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of `DebounceInput` is to improve performance and user experience by reducing the frequency of event handling functions being called when a user is typing fast.

**Use Cases:**  
- Autocomplete search boxes that fetch data from an API as the user types.
- Filtering lists or tables based on user input.
- Any other form input where rapid user typing may lead to excessive processing or API calls.

**Structure and Usage:**

```python
from nextpy.components.core import DebounceInput

# Create a DebounceInput with a debounce timeout of 500ms
debounce_input = DebounceInput.create(
    debounce_timeout=500,
    on_change=my_change_handler,
    placeholder="Type to search..."
)
```

### Anatomy

**Basic Implementation:**

```python
debounce_input = DebounceInput.create(
    debounce_timeout=300,  # Delay in milliseconds
    on_change=my_change_handler,  # Event handler for change event
    value="Initial text",  # Initial value for the input
)
```

**Advanced Implementation:**

```python
# Custom DebounceInput with additional properties
debounce_input = DebounceInput.create(
    min_length=3,  # Minimum length to trigger onChange
    debounce_timeout=500,
    force_notify_by_enter=True,  # Trigger onChange when Enter key is pressed
    force_notify_on_blur=True,  # Trigger onChange when input loses focus
    value=my_var,  # Binding the input value to a Var instance
    style=my_style,  # Applying custom styles
    on_change=my_change_handler,  # Bind the change event to a handler
    placeholder="Type here...",  # Placeholder text
    autofocus=True,  # Automatically focus the input
)
```

### Components

**Properties Table:**

| Prop Name               | Type                            | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `min_length`            | `Union[Var[int], int]`          | Minimum number of characters to trigger onChange.             |
| `debounce_timeout`      | `Union[Var[int], int]`          | The debounce delay in milliseconds.                           |
| `force_notify_by_enter` | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`        | Whether to trigger onChange when the Enter key is pressed.    |
| `force_notify_on_blur`  | `Union[Var[bool], bool]`        | Whether to trigger onChange when the input loses focus.       |
| `value`                 | `Union[Var[str], str]`          | The value of the input field.                                 |
| `input_ref`             | `Union[Var[str], str]`          | Reference to the input element.                               |
| `element`               | `Union[Var[Type[Component]], Type[Component]]` | The underlying element to render.                      |
| `style`                 | `Style`                         | Style object to define custom styles for the input.           |
| `...`                   | `...`                           | Other props are passed directly to the child component.       |

**Event Triggers:**

| Event Name             | Description                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `on_change`            | Event triggered when the input value is changed.    |
| `on_blur`              | Event triggered when the input field loses focus.   |
| `on_focus`             | Event triggered when the input field gains focus.   |
| `on_mouse_enter`       | Event triggered when the mouse enters the input.    |
| `...`                  | Other DOM-related events are available.             |

### Notes

- The `DebounceInput` component must only wrap around a single child component.
- An `on_change` handler is necessary to capture the changes in the input field after the debounce timeout.

### Best Practices

- **Debounce Timeout:** Choose an appropriate `debounce_timeout` value that balances between user experience and the performance needs of your application.
- **Minimum Length:** When using `min_length`, ensure that it makes sense for your use case to avoid unnecessary processing for very short input values.
- **Force Notify Options:** Use `force_notify_by_enter` and `force_notify_on_blur` judiciously to ensure they align with user expectations in the context of your application.
- **Styling:** Apply custom styles through the `style` property to ensure the `DebounceInput` component aligns with your application's design system.
- **Event Handling:** Always define the necessary event handlers such as `on_change` to properly handle user interactions with the input field.

Remember to keep the documentation updated to reflect any changes in the API or best practices and to provide examples that are relevant and easily understandable by developers with varying levels of expertise.
