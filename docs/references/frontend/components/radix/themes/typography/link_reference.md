# Nextpy Documentation - `Link` Component

## Link Component

The `Link` component in Nextpy is designed to represent a hyperlink that users can click to navigate to a different URL or trigger actions. It extends the standard HTML anchor (`<a>`) element with additional styling and behavior tailored for use within Nextpy applications, especially with Radix UI themes.

### Anatomy

Below are basic and advanced implementation code snippets for the `Link` component.

#### Basic Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography.link import Link

# Basic link creation
link = Link.create("Click me!", href="https://example.com")
```

This code creates a simple hyperlink that navigates to `https://example.com` when clicked.

#### Advanced Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography.link import Link

# Advanced link with additional properties
advanced_link = Link.create(
    "Download File",
    href="/files/report.pdf",
    download=True,
    color="blue",
    size="3",
    weight="bold",
    underline="always",
    high_contrast=True,
    m="2",
    class_name="custom-link"
)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a more advanced link with various properties set, such as forcing the link to download the file, applying specific color, size, and weight, always showing the underline, increasing contrast for better visibility, setting margin, and adding a custom CSS class.

### Components

The `Link` component has the following sub-components and properties:

| Prop Name          | Type                                                           | Description                                                                                       |

### Notes

- When using the `download` property, the `href` attribute should point to the resource you wish to prompt for download.
- Make sure to use valid URL schemes and paths when setting the `href` attribute to ensure proper navigation.
- The `target` attribute can be used to specify how the linked document should be opened, such as in a new tab with `_blank`.

### Best Practices

- Use clear and descriptive text for your links to improve accessibility and user experience.
- Consider using the `title` attribute to provide additional information about the link when necessary.
- If links are used to initiate downloads, ensure the file paths are secure and the files are safe for user download.
- When styling links, maintain sufficient contrast between the link text and the background, as well as between the link text and regular text.
- Apply the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute when using `target="_blank"` for security reasons and to prevent the new page from being able to access the `window.opener` property.
