## Strong

### Overview

The `Strong` component is a text utility component used to give special importance to a section of text, often by making it bold to stand out. This is useful for emphasizing key points in your content.

### Use Cases

- Drawing attention to critical information in paragraphs or instructions.
- Highlighting important names, terms, or phrases within text content.
- Strengthening user interface messages such as warnings or errors.

### Structure

The `Strong` component inherits from the `el.Strong` element and includes common margin properties and radix theme components to provide consistent styling options.

### Usage

To use the `Strong` component, import it from its module and use it as you would with any regular HTML strong element, but with additional styling and customization capabilities provided by Nextpy:

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography import Strong

# Basic usage
strong_text = Strong.create("This text is important!")

# With additional styling and properties
styled_strong_text = Strong.create(
    "Pay attention to this!",
    color="red",
    m="3"
)
```

## Anatomy

### Basic Implementation

```python
# Import the Strong component
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography import Strong

# Create a Strong element with default properties
default_strong = Strong.create("Default Strong Text")

# Render the Strong element
render(default_strong)
```

### Advanced Implementation

```python
# Advanced usage with custom color scheme and margin
advanced_strong = Strong.create(
    "Advanced Strong Text",
    color_scheme="red",
    mt="2",
    mb="4"
)

# Render the advanced Strong element
render(advanced_strong)
```

## Components

`Strong` is a singular component and does not have sub-components. However, it can be customized with various properties:

### Properties Table

| Prop Name      | Type    | Description |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| color          | str, Var | Sets the text color using a variable or a string value. |
| color_scheme   | Literal, Var | Applies a predefined color scheme to the text. |
| m, mx, my, mt, mr, mb, ml | Literal, Var | Margin properties to control spacing around the element. |
| style          | Style   | Allows you to apply custom CSS styles. |
| ...            | Various | Standard HTML attributes such as `id`, `class_name`, and event handlers like `on_click`. |

### Event Triggers

The `Strong` component can respond to various event triggers such as `on_click`, `on_mouse_enter`, `on_focus`, etc. These events can be used to execute custom behavior when the user interacts with the component.

## Notes

- The `Strong` component should be used semantically to denote importance and not just for visual bolding of text.
- Custom styles and classes can be applied, but they should not conflict with the intended use of the component.

## Best Practices

- Utilize the `Strong` component to emphasize key parts of your content, making it more accessible and easier to navigate for users.
- Avoid overusing the component, as too much emphasis can be counterproductive and reduce the impact of the content.
- When using color properties, ensure that there is sufficient contrast for readability and accessibility purposes.
- Combine the `Strong` component with other typography components provided by Nextpy to create a cohesive and visually appealing interface.
