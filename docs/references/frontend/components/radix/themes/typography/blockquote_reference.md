# Blockquote Component

## Overview

The `Blockquote` component is designed to display a section that is quoted from another source, visually distinguishing the quote from the rest of the text content. It is ideal for testimonials, reference to external content, or highlighting significant statements within your application.

## Anatomy

### Basic Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography import Blockquote

blockquote = Blockquote.create(
    "This is an important quote.",
    cite="Author or Source"
)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography import Blockquote
from nextpy.backend.vars import Var

color_scheme = Var("blue")
size = Var("3")
weight = Var("bold")

blockquote = Blockquote.create(
    "This is a bold quote with a blue color scheme.",
    color_scheme=color_scheme,
    size=size,
    weight=weight,
    cite="Author or Source"
)
```

## Components

### Blockquote Properties

| Prop Name       | Type     | Description                                           |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| color           | `Var[str], str` | The color of the text.                                |
| color_scheme    | `Var[Literal], Literal` | The color scheme from predefined palette.     |
| size            | `Var[Literal], Literal` | The size of the text, where "1" is the smallest and "9" is the largest. |
| weight          | `Var[Literal], Literal` | The font weight (light, regular, medium, bold).  |
| high_contrast   | `Var[bool], bool` | Renders text with higher contrast.                    |
| cite            | `Var[Union[str, int, bool]], Union[str, int, bool]` | The citation or title of the work quoted.  |
| ...             |          | Other HTML attributes and custom properties.          |

### Event Triggers

- `on_blur`: Triggered when the component loses focus.
- `on_click`: Triggered when the component is clicked.
- `on_focus`: Triggered when the component gains focus.
- `...`: Other standard HTML event triggers.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `cite` attribute is used accurately to reference the original author or source of the quoted text.
- When using variables for properties like `color_scheme`, ensure they are declared with the `Var` class for reactivity.

## Best Practices

- Use the `color_scheme` property to maintain consistency with the application's design system.
- Choose the `size` and `weight` appropriately to maintain readability and visual hierarchy within your application.
- Remember that the `Blockquote` component should be used for content that is a direct quote from another source. Don't use it for emphasizing parts of your own content. Use `<Strong>` or `<Emphasis>` elements for that purpose.
- Keep accessibility in mind: use high contrast when needed to ensure that the text is readable by everyone, including users with visual impairments.
