# Kbd Component Documentation

## Overview

The `Kbd` component is a styled keyboard input representation, often used to display keyboard shortcuts on screen. It inherits from the `RadixThemesComponent` and common HTML elements to provide a visually appealing and semantic way to indicate user input commands. Typically, it appears as a visual aid in documentation or tutorials where keyboard navigation or shortcuts are explained.

## Anatomy

To use the `Kbd` component within Nextpy, import it and create an instance with the desired properties. Here's a basic example:

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography import Kbd

# Basic usage
kbd_component = Kbd.create("Ctrl + S")
```

An advanced usage example might include additional styling or event handling:

```python
# Advanced usage with custom color, size, and event handling
kbd_component = Kbd.create(
    "Ctrl + Alt + Del",
    color="red",
    size="3",
    on_click=lambda event: print("Kbd clicked")
)
```

## Components

The `Kbd` component properties are as follows:

| Prop Name         | Type                                                         | Description                                             |

| color_scheme      | `Var[Literal[...]], Literal[...]`                            | Map to Radix color property.                            |

| m, mx, my, mt, mr, mb, ml | `Var[Literal["1"-"9"]], Literal["1"-"9"]`           | Margin properties with shorthand support.               |
| style             | `Style`                                                      | Style object for custom styles.                         |
| key               | `Any`                                                        | Unique key for the component.                           |
| id                | `Any`                                                        | The id for the component.                               |
| class_name        | `Any`                                                        | The class name for the component.                       |
| autofocus         | `bool`                                                       | Whether the component should focus on page load.        |
| custom_attrs      | `Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]`                                 | Custom attributes for the element.                      |
| on_blur, on_click, etc. | `EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar`      | Event handlers for respective events.                   |

All standard HTML element attributes are also supported, like `access_key`, `content_editable`, and `spell_check`.

## Notes

- It is important to ensure that the `color` and `color_scheme` properties are set to acceptable values for proper rendering.
- The `size` property should be within the allowed range ("1" to "9") for consistent typography.

## Best Practices

- Use the `Kbd` component to display keyboard commands or shortcuts clearly to the users.
- When customizing styles, ensure that the component remains visually distinguishable as a keyboard key.
- Use appropriate margins and sizes to maintain readability and visual harmony with surrounding content.
- Always provide accessible names and descriptions when using the `Kbd` component interactively, adhering to web accessibility standards.
