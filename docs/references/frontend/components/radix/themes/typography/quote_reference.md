# Nextpy Documentation: Quote Component

## Quote

The `Quote` component allows you to display a blockquote or a section that is quoted from another source, often used to draw attention to a particular quotation or piece of text.

### Anatomy

The `Quote` component inherits from `el.Q`, `CommonMarginProps`, and `RadixThemesComponent`. It can be customized using various properties, including color schemes, margins, and event handlers.

#### Basic Usage:

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography import Quote

quote = Quote.create(
    "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.",
    cite="Steve Jobs"
)
```

#### Advanced Usage:

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.typography import Quote

quote = Quote.create(
    "Stay hungry, stay foolish.",
    cite="Steve Jobs",
    color="purple",
    m="4",
    on_click=lambda event: print("Quote clicked")
)
```

### Components

#### Event Triggers:

- `on_blur`: Triggered when the component loses focus.
- `on_click`: Triggered when the component is clicked.
- `on_context_menu`: Triggered when the context menu is requested on the component.
- `on_double_click`: Triggered when the component is double-clicked.
- `...`: Other event triggers.

### Notes

- Ensure that the `cite` attribute is used to reference the source of the quotation when applicable.
- Custom styles can be applied using the `style` property to match the design requirements.
- Always provide meaningful `key` and `id` properties to maintain the component's identity across re-renders.

### Best Practices

- Use the `Quote` component to highlight significant statements or testimonials that require emphasis.
- Select a suitable `color_scheme` that matches the context and design of your application.
- Utilize the `on_click` event to allow users to interact with the quote, such as revealing more information about the source.
- When using margins (`m`, `mx`, `my`, etc.), choose values that maintain proper spacing and layout consistency.
- Keep accessibility in mind by providing appropriate `access_key` and `aria` attributes when necessary.

Remember to keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes in the API and to provide examples that facilitate a smooth developer experience.
