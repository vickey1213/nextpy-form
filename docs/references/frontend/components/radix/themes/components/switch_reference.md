# Nextpy Documentation: Switch Component

## Switch

The `Switch` component is a toggleable control that allows the user to switch between two states, such as on or off. It is commonly used for settings or preferences that can be enabled or disabled.

### Use Cases
- Toggling a setting on or off in a settings panel.
- Switching between dark and light mode.
- Enabling or disabling features in an application.

### Anatomy
The `Switch` component consists of the following key parts:
- **Track**: The background element that shows the active and inactive states.
- **Thumb**: The circular element that the user drags or clicks to toggle the switch.

#### Basic Example
```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components import Switch

# Create a switch
switch = Switch.create()
```

#### Advanced Example
```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components import Switch

# Create a switch with custom properties
switch = Switch.create(
    default_checked=True,
    disabled=False,
    size="2",
    color_scheme="green",
    on_checked_change=handle_checked_change
)

def handle_checked_change(event):
    print("Switch state changed:", event.target.checked)
```

### Components

**Switch** has the following configurable properties:

`custom_attrs`     | `Dict`                 | Custom attributes for the component.

#### Event Triggers
Event Name             | Description
-----------------------|----------------------------
`on_blur`              | Triggered when the switch loses focus.
`on_checked_change`    | Triggered when the switch checked state changes.
`on_click`             | Triggered on a click event.
`on_context_menu`      | Triggered on a context menu event.
`on_double_click`      | Triggered on a double click event.
`on_focus`             | Triggered when the switch gains focus.
`on_mount`             | Triggered when the switch is mounted.
`on_mouse_down`        | Triggered on a mouse down event.
`on_mouse_enter`       | Triggered when the mouse enters the switch area.
`on_mouse_leave`       | Triggered when the mouse leaves the switch area.
`on_mouse_move`        | Triggered on a mouse move event.

### Notes
- The `Switch` component must be used within a form or handle its state changes to function properly.
- The `default_checked` prop is used for uncontrolled components, whereas `checked` is for controlled components.

### Best Practices
- Use `on_checked_change` to handle state changes and perform actions based on the switch's state.
- Provide a label associated with the switch for accessibility.
- Avoid using the switch for actions that have immediate effect; use a button instead.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using the `Switch` component within the Nextpy library, ensuring developers can effectively implement and customize it to fit their application needs.
