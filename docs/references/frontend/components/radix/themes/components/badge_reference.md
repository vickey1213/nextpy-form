## Badge Component

### Overview

The Badge component is a UI element commonly used to display a small piece of information such as a count, a status, or a label in a rounded rectangle. It's often used to draw attention or highlight certain attributes, like new notifications or messages.

### Use Cases

- **Notifications**: Displaying the number of unread messages or notifications.
- **Status Indicators**: Showing the status of an item, like 'Active', 'Pending', or 'Expired'.
- **Labels**: Adding labels like 'Sale', 'New', or 'Hot' to products or items.

### Anatomy

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.badge import Badge

# Basic usage:
badge = Badge.create("3", color_scheme="blue")

# Advanced usage with custom properties:
badge = Badge.create(
    "New",
    color_scheme="green",
    variant="solid",
    size="1",
    radius="full",
    style=Style(padding="10px")
)
```

### Components

The Badge component inherits properties from `el.Span`, `CommonMarginProps`, and `RadixThemesComponent`. Below is a description of the important properties:

#### Event Triggers

- `on_click`: Triggered when the badge is clicked.
- `on_mouse_enter`: Triggered when the mouse enters the badge area.
- `on_mouse_leave`: Triggered when the mouse leaves the badge area.

### Notes

- Ensure the `color_scheme` matches one of the predefined theme colors for consistency across your application.
- Using `high_contrast` can be beneficial for accessibility purposes.

### Best Practices

- **Context**: Use badges in contexts where their meaning is clear and they add value to the user's understanding or navigation.
- **Colors**: Choose `color_scheme` that contrasts well with the background for readability and matches your application's color palette.
- **Minimalism**: Keep the text within badges short and to the point. Avoid overloading badges with too much information.
- **Accessibility**: Always consider high contrast options for users with visual impairments and ensure that badges are not solely used to convey critical information.

When creating documentation for your components, ensure all features are covered and examples are provided to demonstrate real-world applications. Keep the documentation updated with the latest changes in the library's API and best practices in the web development community.
