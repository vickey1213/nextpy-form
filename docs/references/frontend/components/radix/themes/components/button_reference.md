## Button Component

### Overview

The `Button` component in Nextpy is designed to provide a flexible and customizable button element for your web applications. It serves as a clickable element, which can be used to submit forms, control interactive elements, or trigger events on a webpage. The `Button` component in Nextpy supports various themes, sizes, and styles to fit different use cases and design requirements.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

To create a basic button, you can use the `Button.create()` method with its default properties:

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.button import Button

button = Button.create("Click Me")
```

#### Advanced Implementation

For a more customized button, you can pass additional properties to the `Button.create()` method:

```python
button = Button.create(
    "Submit",
    color_scheme="blue",
    size="2",
    variant="solid",
    radius="medium",
    on_click=handle_click_event
)

def handle_click_event(event):
    # Your click event logic here
    print("Button clicked!")
```

### Components

The `Button` class inherits from `el.Button` and `RadixThemesComponent`, and includes common margin properties. Below is a detailed description of its properties:

| Prop Name        | Type                                    | Description                                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `color`          | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`        | Maps to CSS default color property.                                      |
| `color_scheme`   | `Optional[LiteralAccentColor]`          | Maps to radix color property.                                            |
| `size`           | `Optional[LiteralButtonSize]`           | Button size, with options "1" - "4".                                     |
| `variant`        | `Optional[LiteralVariant]`             | Variant of button: "solid", "soft", "outline", "ghost".                  |
| `high_contrast`  | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`      | Renders the button with higher contrast color against background.        |
| `radius`         | `Optional[LiteralRadius]`              | Override theme radius for button.                                        |
| `auto_focus`     | `Optional[...]`                         | Automatically focuses the button when the page loads.                    |
| `disabled`       | `Optional[...]`                         | Disables the button.                                                     |
| `form`           | `Optional[...]`                         | Associates the button with a form (by id).                               |
| `...`            | `...`                                   | Other HTML attributes relevant to button elements.                       |

Event handlers such as `on_click` can be added to handle interactions.

### Notes

- When using the `Button` component within forms, ensure that the `type` property is set correctly (e.g., `type="submit"` for form submission).
- Accessibility considerations: provide descriptive `title` or `aria-label` attributes for screen readers.

### Best Practices

- Use the `variant` and `color_scheme` props to match the button's appearance with your application's theme.
- For commonly used buttons, consider wrapping the `Button.create()` method with pre-defined properties for consistency.
- Attach event handlers like `on_click` to the button to define interaction behavior.
- When creating a group of buttons, consider using a `ButtonGroup` component or adding appropriate margins for visual separation.
- When using the `disabled` property, ensure that there is logic to enable the button based on the application's state or user actions.
