# TextArea Component

## Overview

The `TextArea` component in the Nextpy library is a multiline text input control that allows users to enter freeform text. It is commonly used in forms and scenarios where more extensive text input is required, such as comments, descriptions, or messages. The `TextArea` component can be customized with various sizes, colors, and behaviors to suit different use cases.

## Anatomy

The `TextArea` component can be incorporated into Nextpy applications with varying degrees of complexity, depending on the required functionality.

### Basic Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.textarea import TextArea

# Basic TextArea with placeholder
text_area = TextArea.create(placeholder="Enter your message here...")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.textarea import TextArea

# Advanced TextArea with size, color, and event handlers
text_area_advanced = TextArea.create(
    size="2",
    color="blue",
    placeholder="Enter your message here...",
    on_change=lambda event: handle_change(event),
    on_focus=lambda event: handle_focus(event),
    on_blur=lambda event: handle_blur(event)
)

def handle_change(event):
    # Logic to handle text change
    pass

def handle_focus(event):
    # Logic to handle focus event
    pass

def handle_blur(event):
    # Logic to handle blur event
    pass
```

## Components

The `TextArea` component provides various properties to customize its appearance and behavior.

### Properties Table

| Prop Name        | Type      | Description                                        |
|------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `size`           | `Literal` | The size of the text area, with options "1", "2", "3". |
| `variant`        | `Literal` | The visual style variant of the text area.         |
| `color`          | `Literal` | The color theme of the text area.                  |
| `placeholder`    | `str`     | Placeholder text shown when the text area is empty.|
| `disabled`       | `bool`    | Whether the text area is disabled for user input.  |
| `read_only`      | `bool`    | Whether the text area is read-only.                |
| `rows`           | `int`     | The number of visible text lines in the control.   |
| `max_length`     | `int`     | The maximum number of characters allowed.          |
| `required`       | `bool`    | Whether the text area input is required in a form. |

### Event Triggers

The `TextArea` component supports various event triggers:

- `on_blur`: Triggers when the text area loses focus.
- `on_change`: Triggers when the value of the text area changes.
- `on_focus`: Triggers when the text area receives focus.
- `on_key_down`: Triggers when a key is pressed down while the text area is focused.
- `on_key_up`: Triggers when a key is released while the text area is focused.

## Notes

- When setting the `size` property, ensure it is consistent with the design system and provides adequate space for user input.
- The `max_length` property helps to restrict the input length and should be used thoughtfully to avoid cutting off user input unexpectedly.

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive placeholder text to indicate what type of input is expected.
- When using the text area in forms, consider setting the `required` property for mandatory fields to guide users through the input process.
- For improved accessibility, associate labels with text areas using the `id` attribute and the `<label>` element in your HTML.
- To enhance the user experience, provide immediate feedback or validation messages based on the text area input.
- Limit the use of different `size` and `color` variants to maintain a consistent look and feel across your application.
