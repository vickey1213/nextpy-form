# Card Component

## Overview

The `Card` component is a versatile container used for grouping related pieces of content or information. It serves as a building block for constructing more complex UI elements on a page. The `Card` is commonly used in dashboards, article lists, or UIs where discrete blocks of content are presented to the user.

## Anatomy

To create a `Card` component, you can use the `Card.create()` class method, which allows you to define a variety of properties that dictate the appearance and behavior of the card.

### Basic Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.card import Card

# Create a simple card with default properties
simple_card = Card.create("This is a simple card.")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.card import Card

# Create a card with customized color scheme, size, and variant
customized_card = Card.create(
    "This is a customized card.",
    color_scheme="blue",
    size="3",
    variant="ghost"
)
```

## Components

The `Card` component comprises several sub-components and properties:

- `color`: Defines the text color of the card's content.
- `color_scheme`: Specifies the color scheme from a predefined set of color options.
- `size`: Sets the size of the card using predefined sizing options.
- `variant`: Chooses the card style variant such as `surface`, `classic`, or `ghost`.

### Properties Table

| Prop Name        | Type        | Description                                             |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `color`          | `Var[str]`, `str` | The color of the text content inside the card.        |
| `color_scheme`   | `Var[Literal[...]]`, `Literal[...]` | Predefined color schemes for styling the card.       |
| `size`           | `Var[Literal["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]]`, `Literal["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]` | The size of the card.                             |
| `variant`        | `Var[Literal["surface", "classic", "ghost"]]`, `Literal["surface", "classic", "ghost"]` | The style variant of the card.                    |
| `style`          | `Style`     | Inline styles to apply to the card component.              |
| `class_name`     | `Any`       | Additional CSS classes to apply to the card component.     |

## Notes

- When using `color_scheme`, make sure to choose a color that provides sufficient contrast with the card content for accessibility purposes.
- The `size` property affects the padding around the content and possibly other dimensions, depending on the theme and variant.

## Best Practices

- Use cards to segment content into logical groups to improve user focus and comprehension.
- Keep the card content concise and to the point; cards should not be overloaded with information.
- Utilize the `variant` property to align the card's appearance with the overall design language of the application.
- Remember to use appropriate `role` and `aria-*` attributes when necessary to ensure the card component is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
