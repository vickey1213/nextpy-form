# Separator Component

## Overview

The `Separator` component is designed to visually divide content within a layout. It's a simple yet effective UI element that can be used to group or separate different sections of content to enhance readability and organization.

## Use Cases

Separators are commonly used in:
- Menus to distinguish between groups of related menu items.
- Forms to separate different sections.
- Lists to divide individual items or groups of items.
- Layouts to create distinct areas within a single view.

## Anatomy

### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.separator import Separator

separator = Separator.create()
```

### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.separator import Separator

# Creating a vertical separator with specific size and color scheme
separator = Separator.create(
    orientation=Var("vertical"),
    size=Var("2"),
    color_scheme=Var("blue")
)
```

## Components

| Prop Name      | Type      | Description |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| color          | `str`     | Sets the color of the separator. |
| color_scheme   | `str`     | Sets the theme color scheme. |
| size           | `str`     | Sets the size of the separator. Values: `"1", "2", "3", "4"`. |
| orientation    | `str`     | Sets the orientation of the separator. Values: `"horizontal", "vertical"`. |
| decorative     | `bool`    | If `True`, marks the separator as purely visual and not present in the accessibility tree. |
| m              | `str`     | Sets the margin around the separator. Values: `"1" - "9"`. |
| mx             | `str`     | Sets the horizontal margin. Values: `"1" - "9"`. |
| my             | `str`     | Sets the vertical margin. Values: `"1" - "9"`. |
| mt             | `str`     | Sets the margin on top. Values: `"1" - "9"`. |
| mr             | `str`     | Sets the margin on the right. Values: `"1" - "9"`. |
| mb             | `str`     | Sets the margin on the bottom. Values: `"1" - "9"`. |
| ml             | `str`     | Sets the margin on the left. Values: `"1" - "9"`. |
| style          | `Style`   | Applies custom styling to the separator. |
| key            | `Any`     | A unique key for the component. |
| id             | `Any`     | The id for the component. |
| class_name     | `Any`     | The class name for the component. |
| autofocus      | `bool`    | If `True`, the component will take focus on page load. |
| custom_attrs   | `Dict`    | Custom attributes for the component. |
| on_blur        | `Event`   | Event handler for the blur event. |
| on_click       | `Event`   | Event handler for the click event. |
| on_context_menu| `Event`   | Event handler for the context menu event. |
| ...            |           | (Other event handlers follow the same pattern.) |

## Notes

- The `Separator` component should not contain any children; it's a standalone component.
- The `decorative` property is important for accessibility to ensure that decorative separators don't interfere with screen readers.

## Best Practices

- Use the `Separator` to enhance the organization of your UI but avoid overuse which can lead to visual clutter.
- Make use of the `decorative` property for purely visual separators to maintain a clean accessibility tree.
- When theming, ensure that the separator color contrasts well with the background for clear visibility.
- Use margins (`m`, `mx`, `my`, `mt`, `mr`, `mb`, `ml`) to provide adequate spacing around the separator for better visual separation.
