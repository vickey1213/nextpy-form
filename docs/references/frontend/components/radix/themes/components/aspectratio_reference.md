# Nextpy Documentation: AspectRatio Component

## Component Name: AspectRatio

### Overview

The `AspectRatio` component is used to embed content within a container that maintains a specified aspect ratio. This is commonly used for responsive images, videos, and embeds to ensure that the aspect ratio is preserved regardless of the container's width.

### Use Cases

- Embedding a video player that maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio.
- Displaying images within a responsive grid that requires consistent shapes.
- Creating a card component with a fixed aspect ratio preview area.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.aspectratio import AspectRatio

# Create an aspect ratio component with a 16:9 ratio
aspect_ratio_component = AspectRatio.create(
    ratio=16/9,
    children="Your content here"
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.components.aspectratio import AspectRatio

# Advanced aspect ratio with custom color scheme, margin, and event handlers
aspect_ratio_component = AspectRatio.create(
    ratio=4/3,
    color_scheme="blue",
    m="2",
    on_click=lambda event: print("Clicked!"),
    children=[
        # Insert child components or content here
    ]
)
```

### Notes

- The `ratio` property is crucial as it determines the aspect ratio of the content.
- Event handlers such as `on_click` can be used to interact with the component.
- Custom attributes and styles can be applied for further customization.

### Best Practices

- Use meaningful ratios that represent common aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 4:3, etc.) for the best user experience.
- When nesting interactive components inside the `AspectRatio`, ensure that the event handlers do not conflict.
- Keep margins and padding consistent with the design system to maintain a coherent look and feel across your application.

Remember to update this documentation if the `AspectRatio` component's API changes or if new features are added to ensure that developers have the latest information for integrating this component into their projects.
