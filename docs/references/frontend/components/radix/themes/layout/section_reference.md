## Section Component

### Overview

The `Section` component is a layout component that serves as a container for other elements, providing a way to group content semantically. It is typically used to define sections within a page or application, allowing for better organization and styling opportunities.

### Use Cases

- Creating distinct sections within a webpage or application interface.
- Grouping related content together for better semantic meaning and accessibility.
- Applying consistent styling and spacing to different parts of the UI.

### Structure and Usage

The `Section` component is structured as a class that inherits from both `el.Section` and `LayoutComponent`. It can be created with various properties that control its appearance, behavior, and content.

#### Basic Example

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.layout.section import Section

# Creating a basic section with default settings.
basic_section = Section.create(
    "Content of the section"
)
```

#### Advanced Example

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.themes.layout.section import Section

# Creating a section with customized color scheme, size, and padding.
advanced_section = Section.create(
    "Content of the advanced section",
    color_scheme="blue",
    size="2",
    p="3"
)
```

### Components

#### Properties

| Prop Name        | Type                                                  | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `color`          | `Optional[Union[Var[str], str]]`                      | Maps to CSS default color property.              |
| `color_scheme`   | `Optional[Union[Var[LiteralColorScheme], LiteralColorScheme]]` | Maps to radix color property.                    |
| `size`           | `Optional[Union[Var[LiteralSectionSize], LiteralSectionSize]]` | The size of the section: "1" - "3".              |
| `p`, `px`, `py`, `pt`, `pr`, `pb`, `pl` | `Optional[Union[Var[Literal["1"-"9"]], Literal["1"-"9"]]]` | Padding properties for the section. |
| `m`, `mx`, `my`, `mt`, `mr`, `mb`, `ml` | `Optional[Union[Var[Literal["1"-"9"]], Literal["1"-"9"]]]` | Margin properties for the section.  |
| `shrink`         | `Optional[Union[Var[Literal["0", "1"]], Literal["0", "1"]]]` | Whether the element will take up the smallest possible space. |
| `grow`           | `Optional[Union[Var[Literal["0", "1"]], Literal["0", "1"]]]` | Whether the element will take up the largest possible space.   |

#### Event Triggers

| Event Name        | Description                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `on_blur`         | Fired when the component loses focus.                |
| `on_click`        | Fired when the component is clicked.                 |
| `on_mouse_enter`  | Fired when the mouse pointer enters the component.   |
| `on_mouse_leave`  | Fired when the mouse pointer leaves the component.   |
| `on_scroll`       | Fired when the component is scrolled.                |
| `on_mount`        | Fired when the component is mounted to the DOM.      |
| `on_unmount`      | Fired when the component is unmounted from the DOM.  |

### Notes

- The `create` method should be used to instantiate a new `Section` component.
- The `color_scheme` prop accepts specific color literals tied to the radix color scheme.

### Best Practices

- Use the `Section` component to create semantic groupings of content for better accessibility and SEO.
- Apply consistent padding and margin using the `p`, `px`, `py`, etc., properties to maintain a coherent layout throughout your application.
- Take advantage of the `size` property to differentiate between sections of varying importance or hierarchy.
- Utilize event triggers like `on_click` or `on_scroll` to add interactivity to the sections as needed.
