# Nextpy: Radix Theme Components

## Overview

The Radix theme components in Nextpy offer a set of design primitives for building a consistent and accessible user interface with a focus on themes and styling. These components are part of the Nextpy library, which is designed for full-stack Python applications. The Radix theme components allow developers to easily implement a theming system in their applications.

## Anatomy

### Theme

The `Theme` component acts as a wrapper for an application or part of an application, providing a consistent look and feel across all child components. It allows developers to set the overall color scheme, appearance, and scaling for the enclosed elements.

```python
theme = Theme.create(
    children=[...],  # child components
    color="black",
    color_scheme="blue",
    has_background=True,
    appearance="light",
    accent_color="blue",
    gray_color="slate",
    panel_background="solid",
    radius="medium",
    scaling="100%"
    # other properties...
)
```

### ThemePanel

The `ThemePanel` component is used to create a themed panel within an application. It can inherit properties from the `Theme` component or define its own theme-specific properties.

```python
theme_panel = ThemePanel.create(
    children=[...],  # child components
    color="black",
    color_scheme="purple",
    default_open=True
    # other properties...
)
```

### RadixThemesColorModeProvider

The `RadixThemesColorModeProvider` component is used to provide color mode context to an application, allowing child components to respond to changes in color mode (light or dark).

```python
color_mode_provider = RadixThemesColorModeProvider.create(
    children=[...],  # child components
    # other properties...
)
```

### CommonMarginProps

The `CommonMarginProps` class is a mixin used by components to provide margin-related properties. It does not render any visual elements but instead applies margin styling to components that inherit from it.

```python
# Example usage within a component
class MyComponent(CommonMarginProps):
    # Component implementation...
```

## Components

Each Radix theme component comes with a variety of properties, some common across all components and others specific to each component. Below is a table of properties for the `Theme` component:

| Prop Name | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| children | `list[Component]` | Child components to be wrapped by the theme. |
| color | `Var[str]`, `str` | Sets the CSS color property. |
| color_scheme | `Var[LiteralAccentColor]`, `LiteralAccentColor` | Sets the Radix color property. |
| has_background | `Var[bool]`, `bool` | Applies the theme's background color. |
| appearance | `Var[LiteralAppearance]`, `LiteralAppearance` | Overrides light or dark mode theme. |
| accent_color | `Var[LiteralAccentColor]`, `LiteralAccentColor` | Sets the default accent color for UI elements. |
| gray_color | `Var[LiteralGrayColor]`, `LiteralGrayColor` | Chooses the shade of gray. |
| panel_background | `Var[LiteralPanelBackground]`, `LiteralPanelBackground` | Determines panel background transparency. |
| radius | `Var[LiteralRadius]`, `LiteralRadius` | Sets the border radius of elements. |
| scaling | `Var[LiteralScaling]`, `LiteralScaling` | Adjusts the scale of all theme items. |
| style | `Style` | Additional CSS styles. |
| key | `Any` | A unique key for the component. |
| id | `Any` | The DOM id for the component. |
| class_name | `Any` | The CSS class for the component. |
| autofocus | `bool` | Focuses the component when the page loads. |
| custom_attrs | `Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]` | Custom attributes for the component. |
| on_blur | `EventHandler` | Event handler for the blur event. |
| on_click | `EventHandler` | Event handler for the click event. |
| ... | ... | Other event handlers and additional properties. |

## Notes

- When using the `Theme` component, ensure that all child components are compatible with the theme properties to maintain a cohesive design.
- The `color_scheme` property should be chosen with accessibility in mind, considering contrast and readability for users.

## Best Practices

- Use the `Theme` component at the root level of your application or major parts of the UI to set a consistent base theme.
- Utilize `ThemePanel` for sections within the application that need a distinct or emphasized styling.
- Implement `RadixThemesColorModeProvider` if you plan to support light and dark modes in your application.
- When setting margins with `CommonMarginProps`, be consistent across components to maintain a harmonious layout.

Overall, the Radix theme components in Nextpy aim to provide developers with a robust and easy-to-use theming system, enhancing the visual consistency and user experience of Python web applications.
