## RadixPrimitiveComponent

### Overview

The `RadixPrimitiveComponent` is a foundational component within the Nextpy Radix primitives collection. It provides a flexible interface for creating and manipulating generic UI elements with custom behaviors and styles. The component is designed to serve as a building block for creating more complex components while maintaining consistency and reusability.

### Use Cases

- Creating custom UI elements that don't fit into the predefined component categories.
- Extending the functionality of existing components with additional event handlers and styles.
- Prototyping new UI concepts quickly without building components from scratch.

### Structure and Usage

The `RadixPrimitiveComponent` follows a common pattern for creating components in Nextpy, allowing developers to define a variety of properties such as styles, event handlers, and attributes. It can render as different HTML elements by specifying the `as_child` property.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.primitives.base import RadixPrimitiveComponent

my_primitive = RadixPrimitiveComponent.create(
    "Hello, World!",
    style=Style(color="red", padding="10px"),
    class_name="my-custom-class"
)
```

#### Advanced Implementation

```python
from nextpy.components.radix.primitives.base import RadixPrimitiveComponent
from nextpy.frontend.style import Style
from nextpy.backend.event import EventHandler

def on_click_handler(event):
    print("Element clicked!")

my_primitive = RadixPrimitiveComponent.create(
    "Click Me!",
    style=Style(color="blue", cursor="pointer"),
    on_click=EventHandler(on_click_handler)
)
```

### Components

`RadixPrimitiveComponent` does not have sub-components. However, it can have children components which are the elements nested inside the component.

### Properties Table

| Prop Name      | Type                                                     | Description                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `*children`    | `Component` or plain content                             | Child elements or content within the component.   |
| `as_child`     | `Optional[Union[Var[bool], bool]]`                       | Change the default rendered element.              |
| `style`        | `Optional[Style]`                                        | Styles to be applied to the component.            |
| `key`          | `Optional[Any]`                                          | A unique key for the component.                   |
| `id`           | `Optional[Any]`                                          | The DOM id for the component.                     |
| `class_name`   | `Optional[Any]`                                          | The CSS class for the component.                  |
| `autofocus`    | `Optional[bool]`                                         | Autofocus the component on page load.             |
| `custom_attrs` | `Optional[Dict[str, Union[Var, str]]]`                   | Custom attributes for the element.                |
| `on_blur`      | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Event handler for the blur event.  |
| `on_click`     | `Optional[Union[EventHandler, EventSpec, list, function, BaseVar]]` | Event handler for the click event. |

### Event Triggers

Event triggers are properties that accept event handlers to be executed when the corresponding event occurs. Examples of event triggers are `on_click`, `on_focus`, `on_mouse_enter`, and `on_scroll`.

### Notes

- When using `RadixPrimitiveComponent`, ensure that properties such as `id` and `key` are unique within the context they are used to maintain component identity and avoid conflicts.
- Custom attributes should be used sparingly and with consideration for accessibility and valid HTML practices.

### Best Practices

- Use `RadixPrimitiveComponent` as a building block for creating new components or when existing components do not satisfy project requirements.
- Keep the component's API clean and focused on its intended use to avoid bloating with unnecessary functionality.
- Consider performance implications when applying styles and event handlers, especially for components that will be rendered frequently or in large numbers.

By following these guidelines, your documentation will enable developers to effectively leverage `RadixPrimitiveComponent` in their full-stack Python applications, promoting a smooth and productive development experience.
