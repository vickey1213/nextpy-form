## Var

### Overview
The `Var` class is a central component of Nextpy's state management system, facilitating reactive programming in Python. It serves as a wrapper around Python variables, allowing developers to create UI elements that automatically update when the underlying data changes.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation
To create a new reactive variable with Nextpy, you can use the `Var` class as follows:

```python
from nextpy import Var

# Creating a reactive variable
counter = Var.create(0)
```

#### Advanced Implementation
For more complex scenarios, you might need to create variables with additional options, like local state or encoded as strings:

```python
# Creating a local variable (not part of the global state)
local_var = Var.create(42, _var_is_local=True)

# Creating a variable that should be treated as a string
string_var = Var.create("Hello, Nextpy!", _var_is_string=True)
```

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name                               | Type          | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `_var_name`                             | `str`         | The name of the variable.                                    |
| `_var_type`                             | `Type`        | The Python type of the wrapped variable.                     |
| `_var_is_local`                         | `bool`        | Indicates if the variable is local (not part of global state). |
| `_var_is_string`                        | `bool`        | Indicates if the variable should be treated as a string.     |
| `_var_full_name_needs_state_prefix`     | `bool`        | Determines if the variable's full name requires a state prefix. |
| `_var_data`                             | `VarData`     | Data associated with the variable, including state and imports. |

#### Event Triggers
- `create`: Instantiates a new `Var` with a given value.
- `create_safe`: Similar to `create`, but ensures the variable is properly encapsulated.
- `operation`: Executes an operation (e.g., arithmetic or comparison) on the variable.
- `compare`: Compares the `Var` instance with another variable.
- `to_string`: Converts the variable into a string representation.
- `foreach`: Applies a function to each element if the variable is iterable.
- `range`: Creates a `Var` instance representing a range of numbers.

### Notes
- `Var` instances should not be directly modified. Use provided methods to update their state.
- Use `create_safe` when unsure about the safety of the variable's encapsulation.

### Best Practices
- Leverage `Var` to create responsive and dynamic UI elements that automatically update when data changes.
- Use `ComputedVar` and `cached_var` to define variables with dependencies that should only be recalculated when necessary.
- Keep variables as local as possible to avoid unnecessary global state dependencies.
- Ensure that event triggers, such as `create` and `operation`, are used within the correct context, typically within Nextpy's functional components or hooks.

## BaseVar

### Overview
`BaseVar` is a subclass of `Var`, designed for more advanced use cases where additional metadata or custom behavior is required.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation
`BaseVar` is typically not instantiated directly by users, but understanding its structure is important for extending Nextpy's functionality:

```python
@dataclass(eq=False)
class BaseVar(Var):
    # Inherits all properties and methods from Var
    # ...
```

#### Advanced Implementation
Creating a custom `BaseVar` involves subclassing and potentially overriding methods to achieve desired behaviors:

```python
@dataclass(eq=False)
class MyCustomVar(BaseVar):
    def get_default_value(self):
        # Custom logic to determine the default value
        return "default"

    def get_setter_name(self, include_state=True):
        # Custom logic to determine the setter function name
        return "setMyCustomVar"
```

### Components

#### Properties Table
`BaseVar` inherits all properties from `Var` and does not introduce additional properties of its own.

#### Event Triggers
- `get_default_value`: Returns the default value for the variable.
- `get_setter_name`: Retrieves the name of the setter function for updating the variable's value.

### Notes
- `BaseVar` should be used when you need to extend the functionality of `Var` with custom behaviors.
- Override `get_default_value` and `get_setter_name` carefully, as they can affect how the variable interacts with Nextpy's state management.

### Best Practices
- Utilize `BaseVar` when creating custom reactive data structures that require more than the basic functionality provided by `Var`.
- Ensure compatibility with Nextpy's state management by conforming to the expected interfaces and behaviors when overriding methods.

## ComputedVar

### Overview
`ComputedVar` is a specialized variant of `Var` that represents a computed property. It allows you to define a variable whose value is derived from other reactive variables, recalculating only when its dependencies change.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation
Define a computed variable by annotating a method with the `cached_var` decorator:

```python
class MyComponent(State):
    counter = Var.create(0)

    @cached_var
    def doubled_counter(self):
        return self.counter * 2
```

#### Advanced Implementation
For more complex dependencies, you may need to manually manage the caching and dirty marking:

```python
class ComplexComponent(State):
    value_a = Var.create(10)
    value_b = Var.create(20)

    @cached_var
    def combined_value(self):
        # Perform complex calculations
        return self.value_a + self.value_b

    def update_values(self, new_a, new_b):
        # Update values and mark the computed var as dirty
        self.value_a = new_a
        self.value_b = new_b
        self.combined_value.mark_dirty(self)
```

### Components

#### Properties Table

| Prop Name             | Type             | Description                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `_var_cache`          | `bool`           | Indicates if the computed variable should be cached. |
| `fget`                | `FunctionType`   | The getter function that computes the variable's value. |

#### Event Triggers
- `__get__`: Retrieves the value of the computed variable, triggering a recalculation if necessary.
- `mark_dirty`: Marks the variable as dirty, indicating that its value needs to be recalculated.

### Notes
- Computed variables should be used for values that depend on other reactive variables.
- To ensure efficient updates, `ComputedVar` should only be marked dirty when the underlying dependencies have changed.

### Best Practices
- Use `cached_var` to create computed properties that react to changes in their dependencies.
- Minimize the number of dependencies for computed variables to reduce the potential for unnecessary recalculations.
- When manually marking a computed variable as dirty, verify that all dependent variables have been updated.

## CallableVar

### Overview
`CallableVar` is a variant of `BaseVar` that wraps a callable function, allowing the function to be treated as a reactive variable.

### Anatomy

#### Basic Implementation
Instantiate a `CallableVar` by passing a callable function that returns a `BaseVar`:

```python
def compute_something():
    # Compute and return a value
    return Var.create(99)

callable_var = CallableVar(compute_something)
```

#### Advanced Implementation
Use `CallableVar` when the computation needs to be triggered by a UI event or other reactive changes:

```python
def compute_on_event(event_data):
    # Compute based on the event data
    return Var.create(event_data * 2)

callable_var = CallableVar(compute_on_event)

# Trigger the computation with some event data
result = callable_var(42)
```

### Components

#### Properties Table
`CallableVar` inherits all properties from `BaseVar` and does not introduce additional properties of its own.

#### Event Triggers
- `__call__`: Calls the wrapped function with the provided arguments and returns a `BaseVar`.

### Notes
- `CallableVar` is useful for wrapping functions that perform calculations or produce results that should be treated reactively.

### Best Practices
- Use `CallableVar` to encapsulate functions that you want to integrate into Nextpy's reactive system.
- Ensure that the callable function conforms to the expected return type (i.e., it should return a `BaseVar` or subclass thereof).
